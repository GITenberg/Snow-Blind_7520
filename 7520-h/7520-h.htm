    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Under a noon sun the vast, flat country, buried deep in snow, lay like a
      paper hoop rimmed by the dark primeval forest; its surface shone with an
      unbearable brightness as of sun-struck glass, every crystal gleaming and
      quivering with intense cold light. To the north a single blunt, low
      mountain-head broke the evenness of the horizon line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Garth seemed to leap through paper like a tiny active clown as he
      dropped down into the small space shoveled clear in front of his hidden
      cabin door. The roof was weighted with drift, so that a curling mass like
      the edge of a wind-crowded wave about to break hung low over the eaves.
      Long icicles as thick as a man&rsquo;s arm stretched from roof to ground in a
      row of twisted columns. Under this overhanging cornice of snow near the
      door there was a sudden icy purple darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hugh plunged down into it, his face lost a certain rapt brightness and
      shadowed deeply. He let slip the load of fresh pelts from his back, drew
      his feet from the skis which he stuck up on their ends in the snow, and
      removed the fur cap from his head and the huge dark spectacles from his
      eyes. Then, crouching, he went in at the low, ill-hung door. It stuck to
      its sill, and he cursed it; all his movements expressed the anger of
      frustration. He slammed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buried in drifts, the cabin was dim even at this bright hour of noon. The
      stove glowed in a corner with a subdued redness, its bulging cheeks and
      round mouth dully scarlet. The low room was pleasant to look at, for it
      had the beauty of brown bark and the salmon tints of old rough boards, and
      its furniture, wrought painstakingly by an unskillful hand, had the charm
      of all handwork even when unskilled. Some of the chairs were rudely
      carved, one great throne especially, awkward, pretentious, and carefully
      ornate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, too, a solid table in the center of the floor; and on it a
      woman was setting heavy earthenware plates nicked and discolored. She was
      heavy and discolored herself, but like the stove, she too seemed to have a
      dull glow. She was no longer young, but she might still have encouraged
      her youthfulness to linger pleasantly; she was not in the least degree
      beautiful, but she might have fostered a charm that lurked somewhere about
      her small, compact body and in her square, dark face. Her hair of a sandy
      brown was stretched back brutally so that her bright, devoted eyes&mdash;gray
      and honest eyes, very deep-set beneath their brows&mdash;lacked the usual
      softness and mystery of women&rsquo;s eyes. Her lips were tight set; her chin
      held out with an air of dogged effort which seemed to possess no relation
      to her mechanical occupation, yet to have a strong habitual relation to
      her state of mind. She seemed, in fact, under a shell of self-control, to
      conceal an inner light, like a dimly burning dark-lantern. Her expression
      was dumb. She moved about like a deaf-mute. Indeed, her stillness and
      stony self-repression were extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      A youth rose from a chair near the stove and greeted Hugh as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How many did you get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the eager questioning of a modest, affectionate boy who curbs his
      natural effervescence of greeting like a well-trained dog. The tone was
      astonishingly young, a quiet, husky boy-voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you, Pete!&rdquo; was snarled at him for answer. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got my boot
      mended yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boot, still lacking its heel, lay on the floor near the stove, and
      Hugh now picked it up and hurled it half across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to get out into this ice chest of a wilderness and this flaming
      glare that cuts my eyeballs open, and work till the sweat freezes on my
      face, and then come home to find you loafing by the fire as if you were a
      house cat&mdash;purring and rubbing against my legs when I come in,&rdquo; he
      snarled. &ldquo;Thanking me for a quiet nap and a saucer of milk, eh? You
      loafer! What do I keep you for? You gorge the bread and meat I earn by
      sweating and freezing, and you keep your sluggish mountain of bones
      covered. A year or two ago I&rsquo;d have urged you along with a stick. I used
      to get some work out of you then. But you think you&rsquo;re too big for that,
      now, don&rsquo;t you? You fancy I&rsquo;m afraid of your bigness, eh? Well, do you
      want me to try it out? What about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the first part of his brother&rsquo;s speech, Pete had faced him, but in
      the middle he had turned his back and stood in front of one of the clumsy
      windows. He looked out now at a white wall of snow, above which shone the
      dazzle of the midday. He whistled very softly to himself and sank his
      hands deep into the pockets of his corduroys. He did not answer the
      snarling question, but his wide, quiet mouth, exquisitely shaped, ran into
      a smile and a dimple, deep and narrow, cut into his thin and ruddy cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the woman, who went on with her work as though no one had come
      into the room, and the silent smiling youth, Hugh Garth prowled the floor
      like a shadow thrown by a moving light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of forty-five, gray-haired, misshapen, heavy above the waist
      and light to meanness below; a man lame in one leg and with an
      ill-proportioned face, malicious, lined, lead-colored; a man who limped
      and leaped about the room with a fierce energy, the while his tongue,
      gifted with a rich and resonant voice, poured vitriol upon the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the woman spoke. She turned back on the threshold of the kitchen
      door through which her work had been taking her to and fro during Garth&rsquo;s
      outbreak. Her voice was monotonous and smothered; it had its share in her
      unnatural self-repression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell him to be quiet, Pete? You&rsquo;ve been chopping wood since
      daybreak to make up for what he didn&rsquo;t do last week, and you only came in
      about ten minutes before he did. Why don&rsquo;t you speak out? You&rsquo;re getting
      to be pretty close to a man now, and it isn&rsquo;t suitable for you to let
      yourself be talked to that way. You always stand like a fool and take it
      from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete turned. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he answered good-humoredly, &ldquo;I guess maybe he&rsquo;s
      tired. Let up, Hugh, will you? I&rsquo;ll finish your boot after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell you will! You&rsquo;ll do it now!&rdquo; Venting on his brother his anger at
      the woman&rsquo;s intervention, Garth swung his misshapen body around the end of
      the table and thrust an elbow violently against Pete&rsquo;s chest. The attack
      was so unexpected that Pete staggered, lost his balance, and stepping down
      into the shallow depression of a pebbled hearth, fell, twisting his ankle.
      The agony was sharp. After a dumb minute he lifted a white face and pulled
      himself up, one hand clutching the board mantel. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; he
      said between his teeth. &ldquo;How will you get your pelts to the station now? I
      won&rsquo;t be able to take them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There ensued a dismayed silence. The woman had come back from the kitchen
      and stood with a steaming dish in her hands. After the brief pause of
      consternation she set down the dish and went over to Pete. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;sit down and let me take off your moccasin and bathe your ankle
      before it begins to swell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Garth had seated himself in the thronelike chair at the head of the
      table. His expression was still defiant, indifferent, and lordly. &ldquo;Come
      and eat your dinner, both of you,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your lesson,
      Pete. After this, I guess you&rsquo;ll do what I tell you to&mdash;not choose
      the work that happens to suit your humor. Don&rsquo;t, for God&rsquo;s sake, baby him,
      Bella. Don&rsquo;t start being a grandmother before you&rsquo;ve ever been a
      sweetheart. You&rsquo;re too young for the one even if you&rsquo;re getting a bit too
      old for the other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella flushed deep and hot. She went to her place, and Pete hobbled to
      his, opposite his brother. Between them the woman sat, dyed deep in her
      sudden unaccustomed wave of scarlet. Pete&rsquo;s whiteness too was stained in
      sympathy. But Hugh only chuckled. &ldquo;As for the pelts,&rdquo; he said royally,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them down myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella looked slowly up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I don&rsquo;t mean it, I suppose?&rdquo; Hugh demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not answer, but the eyes of the boy and the woman met. This
      silence and this dumb exchange of understanding infuriated Garth. He
      clinched his hands on the carved arms of his chair and leaned a little
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the pelts myself,&rdquo; he repeated boisterously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid to
      be seen at the station. I&rsquo;m sick of skulking. Buried here&mdash;with <i>my</i>
      talents&mdash;in this damn country, spending my days trapping and skinning
      beasts to keep the breath in our three useless bodies. Wouldn&rsquo;t death be
      better for a man like me? Easier to bear? Fifteen years of it! Fifteen
      years! My best years!&rdquo; He stared over Pete&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;In all that time no
      beauty to feed my starved senses, no work for my starved brain, no hope
      for my starved heart.&rdquo; The woman and the youth watched him still in
      silence. &ldquo;That fox I killed this morning had a better life to lose than
      I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be safe for you to go, Hugh,&rdquo; said Pete gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not&mdash;watchdog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sneer deepened the flush on Pete&rsquo;s face, but he answered with the same
      gentleness, fixing his blue eyes on his brother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because not two months ago there was a picture of you tacked up in the
      post-office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella&rsquo;s face whitened, and Hugh&rsquo;s cheeks grew a shade more leaden. &ldquo;T-two
      months ago!&rdquo; he stammered painfully; &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s not p-possible. They&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
      given me up. They&rsquo;ve f-forgotten me. They th-think I&rsquo;m dead. After fifteen
      years? My God, Pete! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; He pleaded the last with a
      shaken sort of sharpness, in pitiful contrast to the bombast of the
      preceding speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see the good of telling you. I was waiting until this trip to
      see if the picture was still there, and maybe to ask some questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; whispered Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means they&rsquo;ve some fresh reason to hunt me&mdash;some fresh impulse&mdash;God
      knows what or why. How can we tell out here, buried in the snows of
      fifteen winters. Well!&rdquo; He struck his hands down on the table edge and
      stood up. He drew his mouth into a crooked smile and looked at the other
      two as a naughty child looks at its doting but disapproving elders. The
      smile transfigured his ugliness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a fancy to see that picture. Want
      to be reminded of what I looked like fifteen years ago. I was a handsome
      fellow then. I&rsquo;m going to take the pelts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete looked dumbly up at him, his lips parted. Bella twisted her apron
      about her hands. Both seemed to know the hopelessness of protest. In the
      same anxious dumbness they watched Garth make ready for his trip. As he
      pulled his cap down close about his ears, Pete at last found his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; he began doubtfully, &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t risk it. We can get on
      without supplies until next trading-day, when I&rsquo;ll surely be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue! I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I tell you, the spirit of
      adventure has me. Who knows what I may meet with out there?&rdquo; He flung back
      the door and, pointing with a long arm, stood silhouetted against the
      dazzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beauty? Opportunity? Danger? Hope? Death? I shan&rsquo;t shirk it this time.
      I&rsquo;ll meet whatever comes. But&mdash;&rdquo; He came back a step into the room.
      His harsh face melted to a shamefaced gentleness; his voice softened. &ldquo;If
      they get me down there, if I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> come back, you two try to think
      kindly of me, will you? I know what you think of me now. I know you won&rsquo;t
      see me as I am&mdash;no one but God will ever do me that kindness; but you
      two&mdash;be easy with me in your memories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella, her arms now twisted to their red elbows in her apron, took a few
      stiff steps across the floor. Her face was expressionless, her eyes
      lowered. Garth smiled at them both and went out, shutting the door. They
      heard him singing as he put on his skis:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A hundred men were riding,
  A-hunting for Pierre.
  They rode and rode, but nothing could they find.
  They rode around by moonlight;
  They rode around by day;
  They rode and rode, but nothing could they find.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then came the sharp scraping of his runners across the surface of the snow
      on a level with the buried roof. It lessened from a hissing speech to a
      hissing whisper. It sighed away. Bella sat down abruptly on a chair,
      pulled in her chin like an unhappy child; her bosom lifted as though a sob
      would force its way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo; She
      was speaking to God.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pete blinked, swallowed hard and began to talk fast and hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come back. I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;ll get halfway there, Bella,&rdquo; he
      reassured the woman. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come to his senses. You know how moody he is.
      Come over here and doctor up my ankle, please. &lsquo;Make a fuss over me,
      Bell.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that what I used to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He coaxed until at last she came and knelt before him and removed his
      moccasin and heavy woolen sock. The strong white foot was like marble, but
      the ankle was swollen and discolored. Bella clicked her tongue. &ldquo;He <i>is</i>
      a brute, you know!&rdquo; She laughed shortly. Since Garth&rsquo;s departure she had
      become almost a human being. The deaf-mute look had melted from her, and a
      sardonic humor emerged; her eyes cleared; she could even smile. &ldquo;Why do we
      care so much for him, Pete&mdash;the two of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete winced under her touch and puckered his brows. &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s such a
      kid, I guess. He&rsquo;s always fretting after the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever get angry with him, Pete? He does treat you shameful
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no. Not often. He&rsquo;s always sorry and ashamed afterward. He&rsquo;d like to be
      as kind as God. I believe if he could only fool us into thinking he <i>was</i>
      God, he could act like Him&mdash;ouch, Bella! Go easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an awful smart boy, Pete. It&rsquo;s a sin you&rsquo;ve never had any
      schooling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schooling! Gosh! I&rsquo;ve had all the schooling I could digest. Hugh beat it
      into me. He&rsquo;s taught me all he had in his head and a whole lot he never
      ought to have had there, I guess. But <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> taught me most, Bella&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the truth of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Me</i>! I never knew anything. They saw to that. They never did
      anything for me at home but abuse me. Hugh Garth was the only relation I
      ever had in the world that spoke kind to me. Remember how I used to run
      over from my folks to tuck you into bed in your little room above the
      shop, Pete? No, you were too little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I remember,&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;The ankle&rsquo;s fine now, Bella.
      Let up. I can&rsquo;t stand that rubbing. Let me stick the foot up on another
      chair. There&mdash;that&rsquo;s great. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt near so bad now. I
      remember Hugh&rsquo;s bookshop; yes, I do&mdash;honest! I remember sitting on
      the ladder and listening to him talk to the students when they came in. He
      always was a gorgeous talker, Bella. They used to stand around and listen
      to his yarns like kids to a fairy story. Just the same as you and I do now&mdash;when
      we can get him into a good humor. But, you know, he used to like strangers
      best&mdash;to talk to, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella assented, bitterly. She had begun to clear the table of its almost
      untouched meal. &ldquo;Because he could put it over better with a stranger. It
      isn&rsquo;t the <i>truth</i> Hugh likes&mdash;about himself, or others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete had begun to whittle a piece of wood. He was a charming figure,
      slouching down in his chair, slim and graceful, his shapely golden head
      ruffled, his chin pressed against his chest. His expression was
      indescribably sweet and boyish, the shadow of anxiety and pain
      accentuating a wistful if determined cheerfulness. He was deliberately
      entertaining Bella, diverting her mind from its agony of apprehension. She
      saw through him, but like a sick child she took the entertainment
      languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, <i>you&rsquo;re</i> too dead bent on the truth, Bella. You know you are.
      You&rsquo;re a regular bear for the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything else,&rdquo; she said gloomily. &ldquo;Things are just so to me&mdash;no
      blinking them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his head a little to one side and contemplated her. &ldquo;What do you
      see when you look into the water-bucket, Bella?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The water-bucket?&rdquo; She flushed. &ldquo;Just because you caught me prinking that
      once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you had a mirror, what would you see in it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An ugly old woman, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! Your mind&rsquo;s just the wrong-side-out of Hugh&rsquo;s. He won&rsquo;t see
      himself ugly, and you won&rsquo;t see yourself pretty. I&rsquo;m the only sane fellow
      in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never in your life saw a pretty woman to remember her. Besides,
      you&rsquo;re too young.&rdquo; She said it with a tart sweetness and vanished into the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her departure Pete&rsquo;s whittling ceased, his hands fell slack and he
      began to stare out through the snow-walled window. His anxiety for Hugh
      slipped imperceptibly into a vague pondering over his own youthfulness.
      That&rsquo;s what those two were always telling him, sometimes savagely,
      sometimes tenderly! &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young.&rdquo; What did it mean to him, anyhow,
      that he was &ldquo;too young&rdquo;? A desolation from which at times he suffered in
      secret overcame him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was twenty-one or -two&mdash;or his memory lied. They had never
      celebrated his birthdays, but he was five or six years old when Hugh had
      been so suddenly, so unexplainably taken from the house, back there in the
      little Eastern college town where they had lived. It was a few months
      later that Bella&mdash;Cousin Bella, who worked at &ldquo;the farm&rdquo;&mdash;came
      for him, a furtive, desperate Bella with a bruised face&mdash;a Bella
      tight-strung for flight, for a breaking of the galling accustomed ties of
      her life, for a terrible plunge into unknown adventure. She had muttered
      to him, as she dressed him and bundled together a few of his belongings,
      that they &ldquo;were going to Hugh&rdquo;&mdash;only it was another name she used, a
      name since blotted from their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh had sent for them. She was the only person in the world that Hugh
      could trust. But no one must know where they were going. They must be away
      by the time the man who took charge of the shop came back in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete remembered the journey. He remembered the small frontier station
      where they left the train at last. He remembered that strange, far-flung
      horizon, streaked with dawn, and his first taste of the tangy, heady air.
      There had been a long, long drive and a parting with the friendly driver
      where Bella turned on to the trail through the woods. It had been dim and
      dark and terrible among the endless regiments of trees&mdash;mazy and
      green and altogether bewildering. And after vague hop-o&rsquo;-my-thumb
      wanderings, he had a disconnected memory of Hugh&mdash;a wild, rugged,
      ragged, bearded Hugh who caught him up fiercely as though he had an ogrish
      hunger for the feel of little boys. It was night when they came to Hugh&rsquo;s
      hiding-place. For miles Pete had been carried in his brother&rsquo;s arms. Bella
      had limped behind them. There had been a ford, he remembered; the
      splashing water had roused Pete, and he stayed awake afterward until he
      found himself before a dancing fire of logs in a queer, dark,
      resinous-smelling house, very low, with unglazed windows. He remembered,
      too, that Bella had burst out crying. That was the queerest memory of them
      all&mdash;that crying of Bella&rsquo;s.&mdash;Even now he could not understand
      exactly why she had cried so then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frightened, furtive life they had all led since&mdash;the life of
      scared wild things&mdash;had left its mark on Pete. His fear for Hugh now
      threw him back into the half-forgotten state of apprehension which had
      been the atmosphere of all his little boyhood. He had not known then why
      strange men were creatures to be feared and shunned. In fact, he had never
      been told the reason for Hugh&rsquo;s flight. Only, bit by bit, he had pieced
      together hints and vague allusions until he knew that this strange,
      embittered, boasting poet of a brother had killed or had been accused of
      killing. In his loyal boy mind Hugh Garth was promptly acquitted. It was
      the world that was wrong&mdash;not Hugh. Yet to-day, after all the long
      years of carefulness, he had gone back to the cruelty of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a beast the boy&rsquo;s anxiety for his brother began to prowl about the
      walls of his mind. He imagined Hugh appearing at the trading-station. He
      pictured the curious glances of the Indians and the white natives. This
      limping, extravagant, energetic Hugh with his whitening hair and eyebrows
      and flaring hazel eyes&mdash;with his crooked nose and mouth, his
      magnificently desperate manner and his magnificently desperate voice&mdash;attention
      would inevitably fasten upon him anywhere; how much more in an empty land
      such as this! Pete fancied the inquiring looks turned from the man to the
      man&rsquo;s posted picture. It was no longer a faithful likeness, of course;
      still, it was a likeness. There was no other man in all the world like
      Hugh! He was made of odd, fantastic fragments, of ill-fitting parts&mdash;physically,
      mentally, spiritually. It was as if a soul had seen itself in a crooked
      mirror and had fashioned a form to match the distorted image. Hugh
      wouldn&rsquo;t, couldn&rsquo;t force himself to be inconspicuous. He would swagger; he
      would talk loud; his big, beautiful voice would challenge attention,
      create an audience. He would have some impossible, splendid tale to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete sat up straighter in his chair, gingerly rearranging the ankle, and
      lifted his blue and haunted eyes&mdash;the eyes of the North&mdash;to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dazzle of noon had faded to a glow. The short winter day was nearly
      done. There would be a long violet twilight, and then, the blaze of stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for his aching ankle Pete would be sliding out on soundless skis, now
      poised for breathless flight down some long slope, now leaping fallen
      trees or buried ditches. He spent half of his wild young restlessness in
      such long night runs when, in a sort of ecstasy, he outraced the stifled
      longings of his exiled youth. But there would be no ski-running for
      several nights now. He was a prisoner, and at a time when imprisonment was
      hard to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only there were some way of getting quick news of Hugh! Why had Bella
      and he let this thing happen? Why had they stood helplessly by and allowed
      the rash fool to go singing to his own destruction? They might have held
      him by force, if not by argument, long enough to bring him to his senses.
      They had been weak; they were always weak before Hugh&rsquo;s magnetic strength&mdash;always
      the audience, the following; Bella, for all her devastating tongue, no
      less than himself. And Hugh&rsquo;s liberty, perhaps his life, might be the
      price of their acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straining forward in his chair, listening, there came to Pete, across the
      silence, the sound of skis.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and hopped to the door, flinging it wide. He could not see above
      the top of the drift which rose just beyond the roof to a height of nine
      or ten feet, but listening intently, he thought he recognized a familiar
      slight unevenness in the sliding of the skis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella!&rdquo; he shouted, his boy-voice ringing with relief. &ldquo;Bella! Here&rsquo;s
      Hugh. He&rsquo;s come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella was instantly at his side. They stood waiting in the doorway.
      Against the violet sky darkening above the blue wall of snow, a bulky
      figure rose, blotting out the light. It half slid, half tumbled down upon
      them, clumsy and shapeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us in,&rdquo; panted Hugh. &ldquo;Let us in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slipping his feet from the straps of his skis, he staggered past them and
      they saw that he was carrying a woman in his arms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut the door,&rdquo; Hugh whispered, and laid his burden down on a big black
      bear-hide near the stove. He knelt beside it. He had no eyes for anything
      else. Pete, hobbling to him, gazed curiously down, and Bella knelt
      opposite and drew away Hugh&rsquo;s mackinaw coat, with which he had wrapped his
      trove. It was not a woman whom they looked down upon, but a girl, and very
      young&mdash;perhaps not yet seventeen&mdash;a girl with cropped dark curly
      hair and a face so wan and blue and at the same time so scorched by the
      snow-glare that its exquisiteness of feature was all the more marked.
      Hugh&rsquo;s handkerchief was tied loosely across her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard her crying in the snow,&rdquo; he said with ineffable tenderness;
      &ldquo;crying like a little bleating lamb with cold and pain and hunger and
      fright&mdash;the most pitiful thing in God&rsquo;s cruel trap of life. She&rsquo;s
      blind&mdash;snow-blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete gave a sharp exclamation, and Bella gently removed the handkerchief.
      The small figure moaned and moved its head. The lids of her eyes were
      swollen and discolored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snow-blind,&rdquo; echoed Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad case,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;Get her some soup, Bella, and&mdash;perhaps, hot
      water&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He looked up helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella went to the kitchen. She had regained her old look of dumbness.
      Beside the figure on the floor Pete touched one of the girl&rsquo;s small
      clenched hands. It was like ice. At the touch she moaned, and Hugh ordered
      sharply: &ldquo;Let her alone.&rdquo; So the boy dragged himself up again and stood by
      the mantel, watching Hugh with puzzled and wondering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what she&rsquo;s been through,&rdquo; Hugh murmured, &ldquo;that little delicate
      thing, wandering for two days, out in this cold&mdash;scared by the woods,
      blinded by the pain, starving. When I found her, you&rsquo;d have thought she&rsquo;d
      be afraid of a wild man like me, but she just lifted up her arms like a
      baby and dropped her head on my shoulder. She&mdash;she patted my cheek&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella brought the soup, and Hugh, raising the small black head on the
      crook of his arm, forced a spoonful between the clenched teeth. The girl
      swallowed and began again to whimper: &ldquo;Oh, my eyes! My eyes! They hurt me
      so!&rdquo; She turned her face against Hugh&rsquo;s chest and clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be better soon,&rdquo; he soothed her; then fiercely to Bella: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
      we do something? Don&rsquo;t you know what to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Bella went to the kitchen, moving like an automaton. Hugh coaxed and
      murmured, feeding the girl in spite of her pain. He managed to force a
      little of the soup down her throat, and a faint stain of color came back
      to her lips and cheeks. Bella presently reappeared with salve and lotion,
      and Hugh helped her hold the swollen lids apart, his big hands very
      skillful, while she gently washed out the eyes. Then they put the salve on
      her sun-scorched face. She sighed as though in some relief, and again
      snuggled against Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away, please,&rdquo; she pleaded in a sweet trickle of voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      scared to feel you gone. You&rsquo;re so warm. You&rsquo;re so strong. Will you talk
      to me again, please? Your voice is so comforting, so beau-ti-ful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Hugh talked. The others drew away and watched and listened. They did
      not look at each other. For some reason Pete was ashamed to meet Bella&rsquo;s
      eyes. As usual, they were the audience, those two. They sat, each in a
      chair, the width of the room apart; below them, his grizzled head and
      warped face transfigured by its new tenderness, Hugh bent over the child
      in his arms. Pete held his tumult of curiosity, of interest, in leash. He
      could hear his heart pounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe now, and warm,&rdquo; Hugh was murmuring. &ldquo;No need to be scared, no
      need. I&rsquo;ll take care of you. Go to sleep. I&rsquo;m strong enough to keep off
      anything. You&rsquo;re safe and snug as a little bird in its nest. That&rsquo;s right.
      Go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete&rsquo;s blue eyes dwelt on this amazing spectacle with curious wonder. This
      was a Hugh he had never seen before. For the first time in fifteen years,
      he realized, the man had forgotten himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Hugh Garth the girl told her story at last. She seemed to realize only
      dimly that there were two other living beings in this house, to her a
      house of darkness peopled only by voices&mdash;Pete&rsquo;s modest, rare boy
      speeches, Bella&rsquo;s brief, smothered statements. The great music of Hugh&rsquo;s
      utterance must indeed have filled her narrowed world. So it was to him she
      turned&mdash;he was always near her, sitting on the pelt beside the chair
      to which, after a day and night in Bella&rsquo;s bed, she was helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a charming fashion of speech, rather slow motions of her lips,
      which had some difficulty with &ldquo;r&rdquo; and &ldquo;s,&rdquo; a difficulty which she
      evidently struggled against conscientiously, and as she talked, she
      gesticulated with her slim little hands. She was a touching thing sitting
      there in Hugh&rsquo;s carved throne&mdash;he an abdicated monarch at her feet,
      knee in hand, grizzled head tilted back, hazel eyes raised to her and
      filled with adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am called Sylvie Doone,&rdquo; she said with that quaint struggle over the
      &ldquo;S.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was always miserable at home.&rdquo; She gave the quick sigh of a child.
      &ldquo;You see, my father died when I was very little, and then my mother
      married again. We lived in the grimmest little town, hardly more than a
      dozen houses, beside a stream, up in Massachusetts&mdash;farming country,
      but poor farming, hard farming, the kind that twists the men with
      rheumatism, and makes the women all pinched and worn. Mother was like
      that. She died when I was thirteen. You see&mdash;there I was, so queerly
      fixed. I had to live with Mr. Pynche&mdash;there was no other home for me
      anywhere. And he kind of resented it. He had enough money not to need me
      for work&mdash;a sister of his did the housework better than I could&mdash;and
      yet he was poor enough to hate having to feed me and pay for my clothes. I
      was always feeling in the way, and a burden. There was nothing I could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I saw something about the movies in a magazine, and pictures of
      girls, not much better-looking than me, making lots of money. I borrowed
      some money from a drug-store clerk who wanted to keep company with me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      paid it back&mdash;and I went to New York. I did get a job. But I&rsquo;m not a
      good actress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She faltered over the rest&mdash;a commonplace story of engagements, of
      failures, until she found herself touring the West with a wretched
      theatrical troupe. &ldquo;We were booked for a little town off there beyond your
      woods, and the train was stalled in a snowstorm. We got on a stage-coach,
      but it got stuck in a drift on one of those dreadful roads. I was freezing
      cold, and I thought I&rsquo;d make a short cut through the woods. The road was
      running along the edge of a big forest of pines. I cut off while they were
      all working to dig out the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Snaring said, &lsquo;Look out for the bears!&rsquo; and I laughed and ran up what
      looked like a snow-buried trail. There was a hard crust. The woods were
      all glittering and so beautiful. I ran into them, laughing. I was so glad
      to get away by myself from those people into the woods where it was so
      silent and sort of solemn&mdash;like being in a church again. I can&rsquo;t
      think how I got so lost. I meant to come round back to the road, but
      before I knew it, I didn&rsquo;t know which way the road was. The pines were so
      dense, so all alike, they looked almost as if they kept sort of shifting
      about me. I tried to follow back on my footprints, but in some places snow
      had shaken down from the branches. And there were so many&mdash;so
      dreadfully many other tracks&mdash;of animals&mdash;&rdquo; She put her hands
      over her face and shrank down in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget about them, Sylvie,&rdquo; Hugh admonished gently. &ldquo;Even if there had
      been bears about, they wouldn&rsquo;t likely have bothered you any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bring myself to tell you about that time&mdash;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, then&mdash;only, how did you live through the night, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;except that I never stayed still. I got out from the
      trees because I was afraid of bears, and I lost my hat. The sun was like
      fire shining up from underneath and down from up above. My eyes began to
      hurt almost at once, and by the time night came, it was agony. The
      darkness didn&rsquo;t seem to help me any either; the glare still seemed to come
      in under my lids. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep for the pain. I knew I&rsquo;d freeze if I
      stood still, so I kept moving all night, trampling round in circles, I
      suppose. Next morning the terrible glare began again. Then everything went
      red. I was nearly crazy when you found me, Mr. Garth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please call me Hugh,&rdquo; he murmured, taking her hand in his. &ldquo;I feel in a
      way that you belong to me now&mdash;I saved you from dying alone there in
      the cold and brought you back to my home. I&rsquo;ve got jettison rights,
      Sylvie.&rdquo; She let him hold her hand, and flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never know what it felt like to hear your voice call to me, to
      feel you pulling me up. I&rsquo;d only just dropped a few minutes before, but
      I&rsquo;d never have struggled up. It would have been the end.&rdquo; She trembled in
      the memory, and he patted her hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why a man like you lives
      off here in this wild place, but thank God, you do live here! Though,&rdquo; she
      added with wistfulness, twisting her soft mouth, &ldquo;though I can&rsquo;t ever
      quite see why God should care much for a Sylvie Doone.&rdquo; She touched the
      lids of her closed eyes. &ldquo;I wonder why it doesn&rsquo;t worry me more not to be
      able to see. Now that the pain&rsquo;s gone, I don&rsquo;t seem to care much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God. Perhaps, though,&rdquo; he added half-grudgingly, &ldquo;in a few days
      you&rsquo;ll see again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just love to see <i>you</i>. You must be wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; he asked, his warped face glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so strong and young, such thick hair, such finely shaped hands and
      such a voice.&rdquo; Sylvie&rsquo;s associates had been of a profession that deals
      perpetually in personalities. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d been blind a long time, I suppose I
      could just run my hand over your face, and I&rsquo;d know what you look like.
      But I can&rsquo;t tell a thing.&rdquo; She felt for his face and brushed it eagerly
      with her fingers, laughing at herself. &ldquo;I just know that you have thick
      eyelashes and are clean-shaven. Is Bella your wife? And that big little
      boy your son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started. &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s a faithful thing, the boy&rsquo;s nurse. And the kid&rsquo;s my
      young brother&mdash;a great gawk of a boy for his age, a regular
      bean-pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard to tell anything about people if you can&rsquo;t see them. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have thought he was so big. Is he about fourteen or fifteen? He
      speaks so low and gently; he might be any age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a man&rsquo;s height&mdash;pretty near too big to lick, though he needs
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bella, what&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dried-up mummy of a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen door creaked. Hugh started and shot a look over his shoulder.
      Bella stood on the kitchen threshold with an expressionless face and
      lowered eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you jump?&rdquo; asked Sylvie nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh wet his lips with his tongue. &ldquo;Nothing. The door creaked. Go on. Tell
      me more, child,&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I want to hear about you now. Tell me your story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh clenched his hands and flushed darkly. He glanced over his shoulder
      with a furtive look, but Bella had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one else rightly knows my story, Sylvie. Will you promise me never to
      speak of it, to Bella, to Pete, to any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I promise.&rdquo; Her face beamed with the pride of a child
      entrusted with a secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, lowering his voice and moving closer to her chair, he began a
      fictitious history, a history of persecuted and heroic innocence, of
      reckless adventure, of daring self-sacrifice. The girl listened with
      parted lips. Her cheeks glowed. And behind the door, Bella too listened,
      straining her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murmur of Hugh&rsquo;s recital, rising now and then to some melodramatic
      climax, then dropping cautiously, rippled on, broken now and again by
      Sylvie&rsquo;s ejaculations. Behind the door Bella stood like a wooden block,
      colorless and stolid as though she understood not a syllable of what she
      heard. But after a rigid hour she faltered away, stumbled across the
      kitchen and out into the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in the broad light of the setting sun, Pete rhythmically bent and
      straightened over his saw. The tool sang with a hissing, ringing rhythm,
      and the young man drove it with a lithe, long swing of body, forward and
      back, forward and back, in alternate postures of untiring grace. The air
      was not cold. There was the cloudy softness premonitory of a spring storm;
      the sun glowed like a dying fire through a long, narrow rift in the
      shrouded west. Pete had thrown aside his coat and drawn in his belt. The
      collar of his flannel shirt was open and turned back; his head was bare.
      The bright gold of his short hair, the scarlet of his cheeks, the vivid
      blue of his brooding eyes, made shocks of color against the prevailing
      whiteness. Even the indigo of his overalls and the dark gray of his shirt
      stood out with a curious value of tint and texture. His bare hands and
      forearms glowed. He was whistling with a boy&rsquo;s vigor and a bird&rsquo;s
      sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella caught Pete&rsquo;s arm as it bent for one of the strong forward sweeps.
      He stopped, let go of his saw, and turned to her, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;the smile gone: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flamed in her pale, tense face. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to stop it, Pete,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Don&rsquo;t stand out here with those bare arms, Bella.&rdquo; He was pulling
      his own shirt-sleeves down over his glistening bronze forearms as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk in the house,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got to talk. I&mdash;Do
      you know what Hugh&rsquo;s doing&mdash;what he&rsquo;s telling that girl? What he&rsquo;s
      letting her believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete shook his head, but at the same time turned his blue eyes away from
      her toward the glowing west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lies,&rdquo; said Bella. She laughed a short, explosive laugh. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got his
      ideal audience at last&mdash;a blind one. She thinks he&rsquo;s young and
      handsome and heroic. Pete, she thinks he&rsquo;s a hero. She thinks he&rsquo;s buried
      himself out here for the sake of somebody else. Oh, it&rsquo;s a regular
      romance, and it&rsquo;s been going on for hours&mdash;it&rsquo;s still going on. By
      now he believes it all himself. He&rsquo;s putting in the details. And Sylvie:
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she&rsquo;s saying, and &lsquo;Ah, Mr. Garth, how you must have suffered! How
      wonderful you are!&rsquo; And&mdash;look at me Pete&mdash;do you want to know
      what we are&mdash;according to him&mdash;you and I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not turn his eyes from the west, even when she shook his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dried-up mummy of a woman&mdash;faithful?&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;m faithful&mdash;an
      old servant. And you&rsquo;re a child, an overgrown bean-pole of a boy, fourteen
      or fifteen years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man stood tall and still&mdash;a statue of golden youth in the
      golden light&mdash;the woman clutching at his arm, her face twisted, her
      eyes afire, all the colorlessness of her body and the suppressed flame of
      her spirit pitilessly apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed gently, &ldquo;what of it?&rdquo; He looked down at her and smiled.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first good time he&rsquo;s had for fifteen years. You know we don&rsquo;t
      make him happy. I don&rsquo;t grudge him his joy, Bella, do you? It can&rsquo;t last
      long, anyway. Fairy tales can&rsquo;t hurt her&mdash;Hugh believes&mdash;almost&mdash;in
      his own inventions. She&rsquo;ll be going back&mdash;her friends will be hunting
      for her. I&rsquo;ll let her think I&rsquo;m a bean-pole of a boy if it makes him any
      happier to have me one. And why do you care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew in her breath. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t suppose I care&mdash;so much,&rdquo; she
      said haltingly. &ldquo;But&mdash;think of the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes widened a little and fell. &ldquo;The girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s falling in love with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete threw back his head and laughed aloud. &ldquo;Oh, Bella, you know, <i>that&rsquo;s</i>
      funny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s tragic. It&rsquo;s horrible. You&rsquo;ll see. Watch her face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have watched it.&rdquo; He spoke dreamily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very pretty and sweet
      face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete, Hugh&rsquo;s robbing <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re young. You&rsquo;re ready for loving. This child&mdash;God sent her
      to you, to get you out of this desolation, to lead you back to loving and
      living, to give you what you ought to have&mdash;Life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as though she had struck him. He started and drew himself away.
      &ldquo;Shut up, Bella,&rdquo; he said with boyish roughness and limped past her into
      the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      In these days Hugh must have known that his magic-making, as he led the
      little blind girl through the forest of his romancing, was at the mercy of
      those two that knew him for what he really was; except for queer, wild,
      threatening looks now and again, he gave no sign. He played his part
      magnificently, even trusting them to come in with help when they were
      given their cue. He had dominated them for so long that even they and the
      picture of him that they held in their minds were not so real as his
      dreams. It was a queer game, queer and breathless, played in this narrow
      space shut in by the white wilderness. And as the slow days went by, the
      low log house seemed to be filled more and more with smothered and
      conflicting emotions. A dozen times the whole extravaganza came near
      collapse; a dozen times Hugh saved it by a word, or Pete and Bella by a
      silence. Their parts were not easy, and although Pete still smiled, his
      young clear face grew whiter and more strained. Sylvie treated him always
      as though he were a child. She would pat his head and rumple his hair if
      he sat near her; once, suddenly, she kissed him lightly on the cheek,
      after he had moved the chair for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear, quiet boy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I frightened you to death, then,
      didn&rsquo;t I? Hasn&rsquo;t anyone ever kissed you before?&rdquo; His cheek burned so that,
      touching it with her fingers, she laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made you blush, poor kid!
      I know. Boys hate petting, don&rsquo;t they? You&rsquo;ll have to get used to it,
      Pete, because I mean to pet you&mdash;oh, a lot! You need some one to draw
      you out. These two people snub you too much. Boys of fourteen aren&rsquo;t quite
      children, after all, are they? Besides, they&rsquo;re interesting. I know. I was
      fourteen myself not such ages back. You&rsquo;re not cross, are you, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were misty, and his hands were cold. He could not understand his
      own emotion, his own pain. He muttered something and got himself away. She
      called him &ldquo;sullen&rdquo; and was angry with him, complaining to Hugh at supper
      that &ldquo;Petey&rdquo; had been &ldquo;a bear&rdquo; to her. Hugh simulated a playful annoyance
      and began to scold; then a sort of nervous fury came over him. He stamped
      and struck the table and snarled at Pete. The young man rose at his place
      and stared at his brother silently. There were two splotches of deep color
      on his cheeks. Sylvie protested: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, please, be so angry with him. I
      was only teasing, just in fun. Bella, tell Hugh to stop. I had no business
      to kiss Pete. But I just wanted to pet something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh&rsquo;s threatening suddenly stopped, and Pete sat down. In the strained
      silence Bella laughed. Her laughter had the sound of a snapped bow-string.
      Sylvie had pushed her chair back a little from the table and was turning
      her head quickly from one to the other of them. Her mouth showed a tremble
      of uncertainty. It was easy to see that she sensed a tension, a confusion.
      Hugh leaned forward and broke into a good-humored rattle of speech, and as
      Pete and Bella sat silent, Sylvie gradually was reassured. Near the end of
      the meal she put out her hand toward Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be so cross with me, Pete! Give me a shake for forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched her hand, his eyes lowered, and drew his fingers away. She
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shy you are&mdash;a wild, forest thing! I&rsquo;ll have to civilize you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; admonished Hugh softly, &ldquo;leave him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he did not look at Sylvie, but gazed somberly at Pete. It
      was a strange look, at once appealing and threatening, pitiful and
      dangerous. Pete fingered his fork nervously. Finally Bella stood up and
      began to clear the table with an unaccustomed clatter of noisy energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long are you going to keep it up, Pete?&rdquo; she asked him afterward. He
      was helping her wash the dishes, drying them deftly with a piece of
      flour-sacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since we&rsquo;ve let it begin, we&rsquo;ll have to go on with it to a finish,&rdquo; he
      answered coldly. &ldquo;After all&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, polished a platter and
      turned away to put it on its shelf&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s not doing anything so
      dreadful&mdash;just twisting the facts a little. I <i>am</i> an ignorant
      lout. I might as well be fourteen, for all I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I <i>am</i> a mummy of a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In pity for her he made to put his arm about her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a goose,
      Bella,&rdquo; he said, but she flung his hand from her. &ldquo;Why does it make you so
      sore and angry?&rdquo; he asked wistfully. &ldquo;Hugh is not pretty to look at, but
      perhaps Sylvie sees him better than we do&mdash;in a way; and if she
      learns to love him while she&rsquo;s blind, then, when she sees him, if she ever
      sees him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chances are she never will. If her eyes don&rsquo;t get better soon, they
      likely never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it horrible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to think so. So long&rsquo;s she has Hugh to paint pictures for
      her, what does she need eyes for? What&rsquo;s to come of it, Pete? She&rsquo;s
      falling in love with the fine figure of a hero he&rsquo;s made her believe he
      is. But how can he marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he go off somewhere else and marry her and start again? Honest,
      I think if Hugh had some one who thought he was a god, he&rsquo;d likely enough
      be one. He&mdash;he lives by&mdash;illusion&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that the word?
      It&rsquo;s kind of easy to be noble when some one you love believes you to be,
      isn&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s Hugh; he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella threw down her rag, turned fiercely upon him and gripped his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a man or a child?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You love this girl yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried and broke from her and went limping out into the frosty
      night with its comfortless glitter of stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as his ankle was stronger, Pete spent all day and most of the
      night on his skis, trying to outrun the growing shadow of his misery.
      Hugh&rsquo;s work fell on his shoulders. He had not only his accustomed chores,
      the Caliban duties of woodchopping and water-carrying, the dressing of
      wild meat, the dish-drying and heavier housework, the repairs about the
      cabin&mdash;but he had the trapping. In Hugh&rsquo;s profound new absorption he
      seemed to have forgotten the necessity for making a livelihood. During the
      first years of their exile they had lived on his savings, ordering their
      supplies by the mail, which left them at the foot of that distant trail
      leading into the forest. Thence Hugh, under shelter of night, would carry
      them&mdash;lonely, terrible journeys that taxed even his strength. When
      Pete grew big enough to load, he was sent to the trading-station, and Hugh
      became an expert trapper. The savings were not entirely spent, but they
      were no longer touched; the pelts brought a livelihood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete had had his instructions concerning his behavior at the
      trading-station; many years before, he had stammered a legend of a sickly
      father who had died, who was buried back there by the lonely cabin where
      he and his &ldquo;mother&rdquo; chose to live. Bella and Hugh had even dug up a mound
      for which they had fashioned a rude cross. It could be seen, in summer,
      from the living-room window&mdash;that mock grave more terrible in its
      suggestions than a real grave ever could have been. There was also a
      hiding-place under the boards of the floor. No one had ever seen the grave
      or driven Hugh into hiding. It was not an inquisitive country, and its
      desolation was forbidding. Pete had learned to discourage the rare
      sociability of the other traders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, the young man had not only to trade his pelts but to trap
      them, and for this business of trapping which was distasteful to him, he
      had not a tithe of Hugh&rsquo;s skill. His bundle of pelts brought him a sorry
      supply of necessities. He was ashamed, himself, and having dumped the
      burden from his shoulders to the kitchen floor would hurry into the other
      room, not to see Bella&rsquo;s expression when she opened her bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night Pete was tired; the load had not been heavy, but the snow was
      beginning to soften under the mild glowing of an April sun, and his skis
      had tugged at his feet and gathered a clogging mass. His body ached, and
      there was a sullen and despairing weight upon his spirit. A mob of rebels
      danced in his heart. He watched Hugh&rsquo;s face, saw the flaring adoration of
      his eyes, thought that Sylvie must feel the scorch of them on her cheek,
      so close. In his own eyes there showed a brooding fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella broke into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better get to trapping again, Hugh Garth.
      Pete&rsquo;s pelts don&rsquo;t bring a quarter of what we need&mdash;especially these
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie quivered as though a wound had been touched. &ldquo;Oh, you mean me,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;I know you mean me. I&rsquo;m making trouble. I&rsquo;m eating too much. I&rsquo;ll
      go. Pete, has anybody been asking about me at the post-office, trying to
      find me? They <i>must</i> be hunting for me.&rdquo; She had stood up and was
      clasping and unclasping her hands. Hugh and Pete protested in one breath:
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Sylvie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pete went on with: &ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been anyone asking about you, but&mdash;so
      much the better for us. You&rsquo;re safe here, and comfortable, aren&rsquo;t you? And&mdash;Hugh,
      <i>you</i> tell her what it means to us to have her here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was more of a speech than he had made since Sylvie&rsquo;s arrival, and it
      was not just the speech, in tone or manner, of a fourteen-year-old boy.
      There was a new somber note in his voice, too&mdash;some of the youthful
      quality had gone out of it. Sylvie took a step toward him, to thank him,
      perhaps, perhaps to satisfy, by laying her hand upon him, a sudden
      bewilderment; but in her blindness she stumbled on the edge of the hearth,
      and to save her from falling, Pete caught her in his arms. For an instant
      he held her close, held her fiercely, closer and more fiercely than he
      knew, and Sylvie felt the strength of him and heard the pounding of his
      heart. Then Hugh plucked her away with a smothered oath. He put her into a
      chair, crushed her hand in one of his, and turned upon Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back into the kitchen,&rdquo; he ordered brutally; &ldquo;trapping&rsquo;s not your
      business. You mind your cooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful, Hugh!&rdquo; Bella&rsquo;s whisper whistled like a falling lash, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      not stand that tone from you. Be careful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; pleaded Sylvie, &ldquo;why do you all quarrel so? Off here by yourselves
      with nobody else to care, I&rsquo;d think you would just love each other. I love
      you all&mdash;yes, I do, even you, Bella, though I know you hate <i>me</i>.
      Bella, <i>why</i> do you hate me? Why does it make you so angry to have me
      here? Does it make your work so much harder? I&rsquo;ll soon be better; I&rsquo;m
      learning to feel my way about. I&rsquo;ll be able to help you. I should think
      you&rsquo;d be glad to have a girl in the house&mdash;another woman. I&rsquo;m sorry
      to be a nuisance, really I am. I&rsquo;d go if I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lonely, deep silence, always waiting to fall upon them, shut down with
      suddenness at the end of her sweet, tearful quaver of appeal. For minutes
      no one spoke. Then Pete followed Bella out of the room. She had not
      answered Sylvie&rsquo;s beseeching questions, but had only stood with lowered
      head, her face working, her hands twisting her dress. She had run out just
      as her face cramped as though for tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the other two had gone, Hugh captured both of Sylvie&rsquo;s hands in his.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, do you?&rdquo; he asked brokenly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;d go
      away if you could, Sylvie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Hugh&rsquo;s voice she started and the color rushed into her cheeks. &ldquo;If I
      make you quarrel, if I&rsquo;m a nuisance, if Pete and Bella hate me so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rdquo;&mdash;he said&mdash;&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; He drew her head&mdash;she was
      sitting in her chair again&mdash;against his side. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t smile at me
      like that; I don&rsquo;t mean the sort of love you think. I love you terribly.
      Can&rsquo;t you feel how I love you? Listen, close against my heart. Don&rsquo;t be
      frightened. There, now you know how I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rained kisses on her head resting droopingly against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can a man like you love <i>me</i>?&rdquo; she asked with wistful
      uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man like me?&rdquo; Hugh groaned. &ldquo;Ah, but I do&mdash;I do! You must stay
      with me always. Sylvie, somehow we will be married&mdash;you&mdash;and I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it frightens me,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;being blind. It does frighten me
      now. I want so terribly to see your face, your eyes. Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t marry
      a blind girl, a waif. You&rsquo;ve been so noble, you&rsquo;ve suffered so terribly.
      You ought to have some wonderful woman who would understand your
      greatness, would see all that you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;now I <i>am</i> great&mdash;because you think I am;
      that&rsquo;s water to me&mdash;after a lifetime of thirst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, <i>am</i> I good enough for you?&rdquo; She was sobbing and laughing at
      the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too much for him. He drew himself gently away. He whispered: &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t bear being loved&mdash;being happy. I&rsquo;ll go out by myself for a bit
      alone. Sylvie, Sylvie! Every instant I&mdash;I worship <i>you</i>!&rdquo; He
      threw himself down before her and pressed his face against her knees. She
      caressed the thick, grizzled hair. He stood up and then stumbled away from
      her, more blind than she, out of the house into the gathering night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the big, rudely carved chair Sylvie leaned back her head and pressed
      her hands to her unseeing eyes. She was not sorry that Hugh had left her,
      for she was oppressed and unnerved by her own emotions. Until he had
      kissed her hair, she had not known that she loved him&mdash;or rather
      loved an invisible presence that had enveloped her in an atmosphere of
      sympathy, of protection, that had painted itself, so to speak, in heroic
      colors and proportions against her darkness, that had revealed both
      strength and tenderness in touch and movement, and warm, deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For until now Sylvie&rsquo;s life had been entirely lacking in protection and
      tenderness; she had never known sympathy&mdash;her natural romanticism had
      been starved. The lacks in her life Hugh had supplied the more lavishly
      because he was aided, in her blindness, by the unrestricted powers of her
      fancy. But now in all the fervor of this, Sylvie felt, also for the first
      time, the full bitterness of her blindness. If she could see him&mdash;if
      only once! If she could see him!
    </p>
    <p>
      And there came to Sylvie unreasonably, disconnectedly, a keen memory of
      Pete&rsquo;s embrace when he had caught her up from falling on the hearth. A boy
      of fourteen? Strange that he should be so strong, that his heart should
      beat so loud, that his arms should draw themselves so closely, so
      powerfully about her. What were they really like, these people who moved
      unseen around her and who exerted such great power over her sudden
      helplessness?
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up and began to walk to and fro restlessly, gropingly across the
      room. She wished now that Hugh would come back. He had been with her so
      constantly that she had grown utterly dependent upon him. The dense red
      fog that lay so thick about her, frightened her when Hugh was not there to
      keep her mind busy with his talk to paint pictures for her, to command her
      with his magnetic presence. She stood still and strained her eyes. She <i>must</i>
      see again. If she tried hard, the red fog would surely lift. Happiness,
      and her new love, they would be strong enough to dispel the mist. There&mdash;already
      it was a shade lighter! She almost thought that she could make out the
      brightness of the fire. She went toward it and sat down on the bear-skin,
      holding out her tremulous, excited hands. And with a sudden impulse toward
      confidence she called: &ldquo;Pete, O Pete! Come here a moment, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came, and she beckoned to him with a gesture and an upward, vaguely
      directed smile, to sit beside her. She was aware of the rigid reserve of
      his body holding itself at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; she said wistfully, &ldquo;what can I do to make you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He uttered a queer, sharp sound, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you jealous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sylvie,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how I wish I could see you, Pete! I know then I&rsquo;d understand you
      better. Pete, try to be a little more&mdash;more human. Tell me about
      yourself. Haven&rsquo;t you a bit of fondness for me? You see, I want&mdash;Pete&mdash;some
      day perhaps I&rsquo;ll be your sister&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he has asked you to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was usually so quiet that she was startled at this new tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hush! We have only just found out. He went away
      because he couldn&rsquo;t bear his own happiness. Pete&mdash;&rdquo; She felt for him
      and her hand touched his cheek. &ldquo;Oh, Pete, your face is wet. You&rsquo;re
      crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he denied evenly. &ldquo;It was melting from the roof when I came
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed. &ldquo;You are so strange, Pete. Will you let me kiss you now&mdash;since
      you are going to be my big little brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and crooked her arm about his neck, forcing his face down to
      hers. His lips were hard and cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face that Sylvie imagined a boy&rsquo;s face, shy and blushing, half
      frightened, half cross, perhaps a trifle pleased, was so white and patient
      a face in its misery that her blind tenderness seemed almost like an
      intentional cruelty. It was an intensity of feeling almost palpable, but
      Sylvie&rsquo;s mouth remained unburnt, though it removed itself with a pathetic
      little twist of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to say anything,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve shown me how you feel.
      You can&rsquo;t like me. You are sorry I came. And I want so dreadfully for some
      one just now to talk to&mdash;to help me, to understand. It&rsquo;s all dark and
      wonderful and frightening. I wish I had a brother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent her face to her knees and began to cry simply and passionately.
      At that Pete found it easy to forget himself. He put his arm very
      carefully about her, laying one of his hands on her bent head and stroking
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a brother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Right here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark small silken head shook. &ldquo;No. You don&rsquo;t like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;I do. Please tell me everything you feel like telling; I&rsquo;d
      like awfully to help you, to understand, to listen to you. You see, you&rsquo;ve
      been so much with Hugh, I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to know you as he does. And
      I guess&mdash;well&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;m sort of shy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her head at that, took his stroking hand and held it in both of
      hers under her chin, as a little girl holds her pet kitten for the
      pleasure of its warmth. &ldquo;You must get over being shy with me, Pete. We
      both love Hugh; we both admire him so. I&rsquo;d so love to talk to you about
      him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do, Sylvie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen him,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;and you can see him all day long,
      Pete; will you try your best now to describe Hugh to me&mdash;every bit of
      him? Tell me the color of his eyes and the shape of his face and&mdash;everything.
      Tell me all you remember about him always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m no good at that, Sylvie. A fellow you see all day long&mdash;why,
      you don&rsquo;t know what he looks like, &lsquo;specially if he&rsquo;s your own brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you certainly know the color of his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has hazel eyes&mdash;I think you&rsquo;d call them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she drank in his words eagerly, pressing his hand tighter in her
      excitement. &ldquo;Go on. If only you were a girl, now, you&rsquo;d do this so much
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know what else to say, Sylvie. He is very
      strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I know that. Didn&rsquo;t he pick me up out of the snow and carry me
      home? He moved as though he had a feather on his arm. You are very strong
      too, Pete&mdash;<i>very</i> strong. Are <i>your</i> eyes hazel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always liked blue eyes. I like to imagine that Hugh is just the Viking
      sort of man I dreamed about when I was a little girl. You think I&rsquo;m a
      silly goose, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep trying to pull your hand away, dear; you can&rsquo;t guess how it
      comforts me. I&rsquo;m awfully alone here, and strange. I don&rsquo;t suppose you know
      how queer and frightening it&rsquo;s been&mdash;this getting lost and being
      brought here in the dark, and then&mdash;living on in the dark, just
      trusting my instincts, my intuitions, instead of my eyes. Voices tell a
      lot about people, don&rsquo;t they?&mdash;more than I ever dreamed they could.
      Pete, there is nothing in that&mdash;that splendid, generous thing Hugh
      did, the thing I am not to talk about, nothing to keep Hugh now from going
      back to the world&mdash;some place&mdash;that is, far away from where it
      happened&mdash;and beginning again, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, Sylvie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed. &ldquo;Of course it was wonderful. If he hadn&rsquo;t told me of it, I
      never should have known half of his greatness; yet I can&rsquo;t help wishing he
      were free. It&rsquo;s sad to think there will always be the memory of that
      dreadful suffering and danger in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sad,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How alone we both are&mdash;he and I! Bella, and you, Pete&mdash;don&rsquo;t be
      angry, please&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think you quite understand Hugh, quite
      appreciate him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has always been lonely. You are so young, and Bella is so stupid&mdash;stupid
      and cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t, Sylvie. I know Bella a lot better than you do. She&rsquo;s not
      stupid or cross&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I like you to stick up for your old nurse. She certainly must have
      loved you a lot to bring you way out here and to stay here all these years
      to take care of you. I wonder where she&rsquo;ll go and what she&rsquo;ll do when Hugh
      and I get married. You&rsquo;re too old for a nurse now, Pete. Do you mind if I
      lean back against you that way? It&rsquo;s so comfortable. I&rsquo;d be happier
      without Bella, Pete, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, Sylvie? Well, Bella and I will have to go away together
      somewhere, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you, dear. I love you a lot&mdash;next best to Hugh. There&rsquo;s
      something awfully sweet about you&mdash;you great strong overgrown thing!
      Your heart goes <i>thump-thump-thump-thump</i>, as though it was as big as
      the sun.... I feel much better and happier now. Things have got steady
      again. Only&mdash;I wish Hugh would come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete gave a strangled sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo; And he began to draw himself away from her. &ldquo;I think I
      hear him now, Sylvie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ashamed of being found with a
      sister leaning against you and holding your hand. Are you afraid of Hugh?
      I think sometimes he&rsquo;s rather hard with you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to speak to
      him about that. Oh&rdquo;&mdash;in a sudden ecstasy&mdash;&ldquo;how happy I am! I
      feel as light as the air. I want every one to be happy. Tell me when Hugh
      comes in how happy he looks, Pete&mdash;promise me, quick! There he is at
      the door now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I promise. Let me go, please, Sylvie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled himself away and stood up. At the instant, the door was opened
      and shut quickly, stealthily. It was Hugh, breathing hard, gray with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;Pete, they&rsquo;re after me. Men are coming
      across the flat.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they see you?&rdquo; Pete demanded anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; Hugh was breathing fast; he had evidently fled across
      the snow at top speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in, then, quick&mdash;out of sight.&rdquo; Pete was already tearing up
      boards above that long-waiting place of hiding. Hugh was about to step
      down into it when he glanced up and saw Sylvie. She was standing as the
      unseeing stand in moments of frightened bewilderment, her hands clasped,
      her head turning from side to side. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; whispered Hugh, still
      absorbed in his own danger, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let them know that Sylvie just wandered
      in here. Don&rsquo;t let them start asking her any questions; it&rsquo;s too
      dangerous. Let her be&mdash;one of the family.&rdquo; He smiled maliciously.
      &ldquo;Let her be your wife, Pete.&rdquo; Then, as though that picture had fired his
      love through its hint of jeopardy, he held out both arms suddenly: &ldquo;Come
      here, Sylvie&mdash;lead her to me, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy obeyed. But as her uncertain arms trembled about Hugh&rsquo;s shoulders
      Pete turned sharply away. He heard the quick, anxious murmur of their
      voices:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, dearest&mdash;are you afraid?&rdquo; And his: &ldquo;Trust me, little darling.
      Love me.&rdquo; A kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a sharp, whispered summons: &ldquo;Quick, can&rsquo;t you, Pete? Get these boards
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Pete turned, Hugh had dropped into the darkness, and Sylvie stood
      flushed and with her hands over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella had meantime been collecting the most characteristic of Hugh&rsquo;s
      belongings&mdash;those that could not be supposed to belong to Pete&mdash;and
      now thrust them down into the hiding-place. The boards were rearranged,
      the rug laid evenly over them. Then the three stood staring at one
      another, listening helplessly to the nearing sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pete,&rdquo; Sylvie gasped, &ldquo;tell me what I must do&mdash;or what I ought
      to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; said Bella, &ldquo;what Hugh told you&mdash;that you are Pete&rsquo;s
      wife. They&rsquo;ll be looking for a different household from that, and it will
      help to put them off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but Pete won&rsquo;t look old enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he will. He looks older than you,&rdquo; Bella declared harshly. &ldquo;You sit
      down and keep quiet; that&rsquo;s the best you can do; and for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t
      look so scared. There&rsquo;s a grave outside to show them, and nobody digs up a
      six-year-old grave. They won&rsquo;t find Hugh. Nobody&rsquo;s ever seen him. Don&rsquo;t
      shake so, Sylvie. They may not even be after him; this country has
      sheltered other outlaws, you know. Hush! I hear them. I&rsquo;ll be in the
      kitchen. Pete, be taking off your outdoor clothes. They&rsquo;ll have seen
      Hugh&rsquo;s tracks even if they haven&rsquo;t seen him, so somebody&rsquo;s got to have
      just come in. Be whistling and talking, natural and calm. Remember we&rsquo;re
      all at home, just quiet and happy&mdash;no reason to be afraid. That&rsquo;s
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through her darkness Sylvie heard the knocking and Pete&rsquo;s opening of the
      door, the scraping of snow, the questions, the simplicity of Pete&rsquo;s
      replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was made known. &ldquo;My wife, gentlemen!&rdquo; And a moment later: &ldquo;My
      mother!&rdquo; And she heard Bella&rsquo;s greeting, loud and cheerful like that of a
      woman who is glad to see a visitor. Chairs were drawn up and cigarettes
      rolled and lighted. She smelt the sharp sweetness of the smoke. There was
      brief talk of the weather; Sylvie felt that while they talked, the two
      strangers searched the place and the faces of its inmates with cold, keen,
      suspicious eyes. She was grateful now for her blindness. There came a
      sharp statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for Ham Rutherford, the murderer.&rdquo; Sylvie&rsquo;s heart
      contracted in her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; laughed Pete, in his most boyish, light-hearted fashion,
      &ldquo;that sounds interesting. But it&rsquo;s a new name to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old case, however,&rdquo; said the man, the man who spoke more like an
      Easterner than the sheriff. &ldquo;Fifteen years old! They&rsquo;ve dug it up again
      back East. The daughter of the man that was killed came into some money
      and thinks she can&rsquo;t spend it any better than in hunting down her father&rsquo;s
      murderer. Now, we&rsquo;ve traced Rutherford to this country, and pretty close
      to this spot. He made a getaway before trial, and he came out here fifteen
      years ago. About two years later he sent back East for his kid brother&mdash;he&rsquo;d
      be about your age now, Mr.&mdash;what you say your name was?&mdash;Garth,
      Peter Garth. You&rsquo;ll have to excuse the sheriff; he&rsquo;s bound to search your
      place.&rdquo; Sylvie had heard the footsteps going through the three rooms. &ldquo;A
      woman named Bertha Scrane, a distant cousin of Rutherford&rsquo;s to whom he&rsquo;d
      been kind, brought the child out. Now, Missis&mdash;what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella Garth,&rdquo; she said tranquilly. &ldquo;I came out here with my husband, who
      died six years ago. He&rsquo;s buried out there under the snow. I&rsquo;ve lived here
      with my son and my son&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s not the household we&rsquo;d been expecting to find. It&rsquo;s a lonely
      place, Missis.&rdquo; He looked at Sylvie. &ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d prefer going to
      some town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re used to it here now,&rdquo; Bella answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d your husband happen here, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His health was poor; he&rsquo;d heard of this climate, and he wanted to try
      trapping. He got on first-rate until the illness came so bad on him, and
      Pete&rsquo;s done well ever since. We haven&rsquo;t suffered any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess not. You don&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;d suffered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The talk went on, an awkward, half-disguised cross-questioning as to
      Bella&rsquo;s birthplace, her life before she came out, her husband&rsquo;s
      antecedents. She was extraordinarily calm, ready and reasonable with her
      replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir&rdquo;&mdash;the sheriff strolled back into the room&mdash;&ldquo;I reckon
      these aren&rsquo;t the parties we&rsquo;re after. But look a-here, this is a
      description of Ham Rutherford. Likely you might have had a glimpse of him
      since you came into the country. When he made his getaway he was about
      thirty-two, height five feet eight, ugly, black-haired, noticeable eyes,
      manner violent. He was deformed, one leg shorter, one shoulder higher than
      the other, mouth twisted, and a scar across the nose. He&rsquo;d been hurt in a
      fire when he was a child&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie broke into a spontaneous ripple of mirth, the full measure of her
      relief. &ldquo;Goodness,&rdquo; she said with utter spontaneity. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s certainly
      never been a monster like that in this house, has there, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did more than all that had gone before to convince the inquisitors.
      From that minute there was a distinct relaxation; the evening, indeed,
      turned to one of sociability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hate to inconvenience you, ma&rsquo;am, but it seems like at this distance
      from town we&rsquo;ve got to ask you for supper and a place to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If it had not been for the thought of Hugh in hiding, that supper and the
      evening about the hearth would have been to Sylvie a pleasant one. The
      men, apparently laying aside all suspicion, were entertaining; their
      adventurous lives had bristled with exciting, moving, humorous experience.
      It was Sylvie herself, prompted by curiosity, believing as she did that
      the monster the sheriff had described bore no possible resemblance to the
      man she loved, who asked suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell us about the man you&rsquo;re hunting for now&mdash;this Rutherford?
      Tell us about what he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Easterner gave her a look, and Bella, seeing it, chimed in: &ldquo;Yes,
      sure. Tell us about his crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete stood up and rolled another cigarette. Try as he might to steady his
      fingers, they trembled. He had never heard Hugh&rsquo;s story. He did not want
      to hear it. The very name of Rutherford that had, in what now seemed to
      him another age, belonged to Hugh and to him was terrible in his ears. A
      sickness of dread seized him. Fortunately the eyes of neither of the men
      were upon him. Sylvie had their whole attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective spoke. &ldquo;He was a storekeeper back in a university town, way
      East, where I came from. He kept a bookshop and had a heap of
      book-learning. I remember him myself, though I was a youngster. He was a
      wonderful, astonishing sort of chap, though as ugly as the devil; had a
      great gift of narration, never told the truth in his life, I guess, but
      that only made him all the more entertaining. And he had a temper&mdash;phew!
      Redhot! He&rsquo;d fly out and storm and strike in all directions. That&rsquo;s what
      did for him. Some fool quarrel about a book it was, and the man, a
      frequenter of the shop, a scholar, a scientist, professor at the
      university, accused Rutherford of lying. Rutherford had a heavy brass
      paper-cutter in his hand. The professor had a nasty tongue in his head.
      Well, a tongue&rsquo;s no match for a paper-cutter. The professor said too much,
      called Rutherford a hump-backed liar and got a clip on the head that did
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ugly story,&rdquo; said Sylvie. Bella and Pete retained their silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder ain&rsquo;t pretty telling, as a general thing,&rdquo; remarked the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, though I&rsquo;ve heard of cases where a man was justified in killing
      another man&mdash;I mean to save some one he loved from dreadful
      suffering,&rdquo; Sylvie replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t know about that. I&rsquo;ve read stories that make it look
      that way, but in all my experience, it&rsquo;s the cowards and the fools that
      kill, and they do it because they&rsquo;re lower down, closer to the beast, or
      perhaps to an uncontrolled child, than most of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there was a time,&rdquo; Bella said, with a smothered passion, &ldquo;when an
      insult to a gentleman&rsquo;s honor had to be avenged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; drawled the sheriff, &ldquo;in them history days things was fixed
      up to excuse animal doin&rsquo;s, kind of neater and easier and more becomin&rsquo; 
      than they are now. Well, Mr. Garth, can we have our beds? We&rsquo;ve kept these
      ladies up talkin&rsquo; long enough. Your mother looks plum wore out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They slept in the bed usually shared by Pete and Hugh. Pete lay on the
      floor in the living-room not far from his brother&rsquo;s hiding-place&mdash;lay
      there rigid and feverish, staring at the night. Sylvie, at Bella&rsquo;s side,
      slept no better. Her imagination went over and over the story of Ham
      Rutherford&rsquo;s crime. She saw the little dark bookshop, the professor&rsquo;s
      thin, sneering face, the hideous anger of the cripple, the blow, the dead
      body, Rutherford&rsquo;s arrest. And when her brain was sick, it would turn for
      relief to the noble story of Hugh&rsquo;s self-sacrifice, only to be balked by a
      sense of unreality. What the detective had told, briefly and dryly, lived
      in her mind convincingly; but Hugh&rsquo;s romance, that had glowed on his
      tongue, now lay lifeless on her fancy. Back her mind would go to the
      bookshop, the gibing professor, the heavy paper-cutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dawn she heard Bella get up with a deep-shaken sigh and go about
      her preparations for breakfast. But it was noon before the two men left.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hugh came up from his hiding-place like a man risen from the dead. They
      helped him to his chair before the fire; they poured coffee down him,
      rubbed his blue, stiff hands. He sat looking up pitifully, his eyes
      turning from one to the other of them like those of a beaten hound. All
      the masterfulness, all the bombast, had been crushed out of him; even the
      splendor of his flaring hazel eyes was dimmed&mdash;they were hollow,
      hopeless, old. For a long time he did not speak, only drank the coffee and
      submitted himself meekly to their ministrations; then at last he touched
      Sylvie with a trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvie,&rdquo; he whispered brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, dear, you&rsquo;re safe now; please speak; please laugh; you frighten me
      more than anything&mdash;why is he so silent, Pete? Bella, tell me what&rsquo;s
      wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been crouching there on the damp, cold ground for hours,&rdquo; said
      Bella, &ldquo;not knowing what might happen.&rdquo; Her voice trembled; she passed a
      hand as shaking as her voice across Hugh&rsquo;s bent head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe now.
      You&rsquo;re safe now,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh&rsquo;s teeth chattered, and he bent closer to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh&mdash;it was cold down there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;like a grave! Sylvie, come
      here.&rdquo; Just an echo of his old imperious fashion it was&mdash;though the
      look was that of a beggar for alms. &ldquo;Give me those warm little hands of
      yours.&rdquo; She knelt close to him, rubbed his hands in hers, looking up at
      Pete with a tremulous mouth that asked for advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;You talk to him, Sylvie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you talk&mdash;you talk. Do you remember how I talked to you when
      you were afraid of the bears&mdash;ah!&rdquo; He drew her head savagely against
      his breast, folded his arms about it, stroked the hair. &ldquo;Sylvie! Is it all
      right? Can it be&mdash;the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you frightened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not after the first. After they had described you, I knew that they were
      looking for the wrong man, and then I felt all right. I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;poor
      Hugh!&mdash;how cold and cramped you were. What a shame that you took a
      false alarm and hid yourself! I don&rsquo;t believe there would have been a bit
      of danger if you&rsquo;d stayed out. They&rsquo;d never even heard of you, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her talk, so gay, so strangely at cross-purposes with reality, was like a
      vivifying wine to him. The color came back into his face; a wild sort of
      relief lighted his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it didn&rsquo;t occur to you, Sylvie, that that brute might have been me&mdash;that
      the men might, after all, have been describing me&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he asked,
      risking all his hope on one throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and, lifting herself a little in his arms, touched her soft
      mouth to his. &ldquo;But, Hugh, you told me your story, don&rsquo;t you remember? And
      it is gloriously, mercifully different from Rutherford&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his chin on his fist and stared over her head into the fire. She
      felt the slackening of his embrace and searched his arms with questioning
      fingers. &ldquo;Why are you cross, Hugh? Did I say anything to hurt you? Let&rsquo;s
      forget Ham Rutherford. I wonder where he is, poor, horrible wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead,&rdquo; Hugh muttered. &ldquo;Dead and buried&mdash;or he
      ought to be. O God!&rdquo; he groaned, and crushed her close against him; &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t ask you to love me, Sylvie&mdash;to marry me. Now you know what it
      is like to love a man who must be afraid of other men. What right have I
      to ask any woman to share my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Hugh&mdash;if I love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you do love me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed out at that, stood up, drawing her to stand beside him. &ldquo;Bella&mdash;Pete,&rdquo;
       he called, &ldquo;do you hear&mdash;you two?&rdquo; He beckoned them close, laid a
      hand on them, drew first one, then the other toward Sylvie. &ldquo;She loves me.
      She sees me as I am!&rdquo; Suddenly he put his grizzled head on Sylvie&rsquo;s
      shoulder and wept. She felt her way back to the chair, sat down, and drew
      him to kneel with his arms about her, her head bent over him, her small
      hands caressing him. She looked at Pete for help, for explanations, but
      she could not see his pale, tormented face.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while Hugh was calm and sat at her feet, smoking. But he was
      unnaturally silent, and his eyes brooded upon her haggardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was several days before Hugh regained his old vigor and buoyancy; then
      it came to life like an Antaeus flung down to mother earth. His hour of
      doubt, of self-distrust, of compunction, was whirled away like an uprooted
      tree on the flood of his happiness. He flung reason and caution to the
      four winds; he dared Bella or Pete to betray him, he played his heroic
      part with boisterous energy; his tongue wagged like a tipsy troubadour&rsquo;s.
      What an empty canvas, a palette piled with rainbow tints, a fistful of
      clean brushes would be to an artist long starved for his tools, such was
      Sylvie&rsquo;s mind to Hugh. She was darkness for him to scrawl upon with light;
      she was the romantic ear to his romantic tongue; she was the poet reader
      for his gorgeous imagery. He had not only the happiness of the successful
      lover, but even more, the happiness of the successful creator. What he was
      creating was the Hugh that might have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Sylvie clinging to his hand, he now went out singing&mdash;the three
      of them together, great Hugh and happy artist Hugh all but welded into one
      man for her and for her love. Those were splendid days, days of fantastic
      happiness. Hugh&rsquo;s joy, his sense of freedom, gave him a tenfold gift of
      fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet one day&mdash;one of those dim, moist spring days more colorful to
      Hugh&rsquo;s heart than any of his days&mdash;there cut into his consciousness
      like a hard, thin edge, a sense of a little growing change in Sylvie. It
      had been there&mdash;the change,&mdash;slightly, dimly there, ever since
      the sheriff&rsquo;s visit. It was not that she doubted Hugh&mdash;such a
      suspicion would have struck him instantly aware and awake&mdash;but that
      she had become in some way uncertain of herself, restless, depressed,
      afraid. And it was always his love-making that brought the reaction, a
      curious, delicate, inner recoil, so delicate and slight, so deep beneath
      the threshold of her consciousness, that in the blind glory of his
      self-intoxication he missed it altogether&mdash;might, indeed, have gone
      on missing it, as she would have gone on ignoring or repressing it, if it
      had not been for their kiss on the mountain-top.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was one of Hugh&rsquo;s madnesses; he would take Sylvie up a mountain and
      show her his kingdom, show her himself as lord of the wilderness. He had
      been there before many times, to the top of their one mountain, always
      under protest from Bella and Pete. It was a bare rock exposed to half the
      world and all the eyes of Heaven; and for a man in hiding, a man who
      lived, yet whose name was carved above a grave, it was a very target for
      untoward accident. Some trader or trapper down in the forest might look up
      and behold the misshapen figure black and bold, against the sky. Yet there
      was never so mighty a Hugh as when he stood there defiant and alone. Now
      he wanted Sylvie to sense that tragic magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went out, Hugh&rsquo;s arm about her, as strange a pair of lovers as
      ever tempted the spring&mdash;the great, scarred, uncouth, gray cripple
      and the slim, unseeing girl, groping and clinging, absolutely shut off
      from any contact with reality as long as this man should interpret
      creation for her. Sylvie turned back to wave at Pete, whom they had left
      standing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hunting for you if you stay out late,&rdquo; he called&mdash;to which
      Hugh shouted back: &ldquo;You hunting for us! Don&rsquo;t fancy I can&rsquo;t take care of
      this child, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of them blind!&rdquo; Pete muttered to himself in answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were moving rather slowly across the rough, sagebrush-covered flat,
      and presently Hugh led Sylvie into the fragrant silence of the forest
      trail. To her it was all scent and sound. Hugh whispered to her what this
      drumming meant and that chattering and that sudden rattle almost under
      their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had to go slowly, Sylvie touching the trees here and there, along her
      side of the trail. He lifted her over logs and fallen trees, and
      sometimes, before he set her down, he kissed her. Then Sylvie would turn
      her head shyly, and he would laugh. Thus they made slow, sweet progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see more in the woods with your eyes than I ever could with my own,&rdquo;
       she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have eyes for us both,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why God gave me the eyes I
      have, because He knew the use I&rsquo;d be making of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the trail Pete follows to the trading-station?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I
      wish you could take me there, Hugh, or&mdash;would you let him take me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tightened his arm. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to have you out of my sight,&rdquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed. &ldquo;It seems so queer that they haven&rsquo;t tried to find me. Do you
      suppose they think that I&rsquo;m dead? Did Pete mail my letter to Miss Foby, I
      wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Miss Foby matter?&rdquo; he asked jealously. &ldquo;What does anything
      matter to you but&mdash;me? Here we leave Pete&rsquo;s trail and I take you
      straight up the mountain, dear one. We&rsquo;ll rest now and then; when we get
      to the rocky place just below the top, I&rsquo;ll carry you. Are you happy? I
      always feel as if my heart melted with the snow when spring comes&mdash;a
      wild, free, tumbling feeling of softness and escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if only I could see. I miss my eyes out of doors
      more than in the house. Does snow-blindness really last so long? Perhaps
      it was the nervous shock and the exhaustion as much as the glare. I am
      sure it all will just go suddenly some day. I stare and stare sometimes,
      and I feel as if I might see&mdash;almost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He frowned. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t miss anything when you have me, Sylvie. Do you
      suppose I miss anything, now that I have you? My career, my old friends,
      my old life, my liberty, the world? That for everything!&rdquo; He snapped his
      fingers. &ldquo;If only I have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love me so much,&rdquo; she answered, as though she were oppressed, &ldquo;it
      frightens me sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are wholly mine&mdash;&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Well, wait till we get to the
      top of the mountain; there I&rsquo;ll tell you all my plans. They&rsquo;re as big and
      beautiful as the world. I feel, with your love, that I can move mountains.
      I can fashion the world close to my heart&rsquo;s desire. We&rsquo;ll leave this blank
      spot and go to some lovely, warm, smiling land where the water is
      turquoise and the sky aquamarine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps my sight will come back.&rdquo; It was almost a prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. They had come to a sharp sudden ascent. He took her in
      his arms, scrambled across the tumbled rocks, and set her down beside him
      on the great granite crest that rose like the edge of a gray wave. The
      clean, wild wind smote her and shook her and pressed back her hair and
      dress. She clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it steep? Are we on the edge of a cliff, Hugh? I&rsquo;m not afraid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the very top of the world,&rdquo; he told her breathlessly, his voice
      filled with a sense of awe, &ldquo;our world, Sylvie, I&rsquo;m master here. There&rsquo;s
      no greater mind than my own in all that dark green circle. It&rsquo;s pines,
      pines, pines to the edge of the earth, Sylvie, an ocean of purple and
      green&mdash;silver where the wind moves, treading down, like Christ
      walking on the water. And the sky is all gray, like stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see the flat, the cabin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The flat, yes&mdash;a round green spot, way down there behind us. The
      cabin? No. That&rsquo;s in a hollow, you may be sure, well out of sight. I&rsquo;m an
      outlaw, dearest, remember. There&rsquo;s a curve of the river, like a silver
      elbow. And Sylvie, up above us, an eagle is turning and turning in a huge
      circle. He thinks he&rsquo;s king. But, Sylvie, it&rsquo;s our world&mdash;yours and
      mine. This is our marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew back. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a feeling for such images? We&rsquo;ll go before a parson&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      be afraid. Would I frighten you, Sylvie? I love you too much for that.
      Why, Sylvie, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his lips, clinging and compelling, had left hers, she bent her face
      to his arm and began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know.... But please don&rsquo;t kiss me like that,
      not like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He released her and half turned, but her hands instantly hunted for him,
      found him and clung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, don&rsquo;t be angry. Be patient with me. Try to understand. Perhaps it&rsquo;s
      because I am in the dark. I do love you. I do. But you must wait. Soon it
      will be spring for me, too. You don&rsquo;t understand? You&rsquo;re angry? But I
      can&rsquo;t explain it any better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can lay your hand on me,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;God knows I&rsquo;m real
      enough.&rdquo; And he thought so! &ldquo;My love for you is here like a granite block,
      Sylvie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. It is the one thing in the darkness that is real. I know you&mdash;your
      love, splendid and strong and brave. Wait just a little, Hugh. Try to be
      patient. Suddenly it will all come right. The fog will lift. Then we&rsquo;ll
      really be on top of the mountain.&rdquo; She laughed, but rather sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will always hate this mountain-top,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I used to love it. I was
      so close to happiness, and now you&rsquo;ve snatched it out of my reach.&rdquo; He
      drew in sobbing breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it&rsquo;s myself I&rsquo;m keeping from happiness, not you,&rdquo; she answered.
      &ldquo;I know it will come right, but you must not hurry me. Dear Hugh, be
      patient.&rdquo; She found his hand and raised it, a dead weight, to her lips.
      &ldquo;Please be patient. Let&rsquo;s go down out of this wind. I can&rsquo;t see your
      world, and I&rsquo;m cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, in silence&mdash;a dull gray silence Hugh led her down into the
      valley.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      They came down the hill rapidly and carelessly. Hugh, stung by pain and
      anger, threw himself over the rocks, and Sylvie was too proud to show her
      timidity or to ask for help. She crept and climbed up and down, saving
      herself with groping hand, letting one foot test the distances before she
      put the other down. At last the rattle of his progress sounded so far
      below that she quavered: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to wait for me, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, and for a moment watched her silently; then, smitten by
      the pathos of her progress&mdash;a little child, she seemed, against the
      mountain toppling so close behind her&mdash;he came swinging up to her and
      gave her his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>need</i> me, anyway, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked with a tender sort of
      roughness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She couldn&rsquo;t answer because she didn&rsquo;t want him to know that he had made
      her cry. She kept her face turned from him and hurried along at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you go so fearfully fast?&rdquo; she was forced at last to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want to get down from this accursed mountain. I want to get
      down into the woods again where I was happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh&rdquo;&mdash;she pulled at his arm&mdash;&ldquo;you are only a child after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped. &ldquo;Go home alone, then. I&rsquo;ll be no worse off than
      when you found me the first time. Pete will come out and hunt for me. He
      has a far sweeter temper than you, Hugh, and doesn&rsquo;t think only of
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swung away at that, resting his hand against a big rock to clear a
      hole; then, seeing her about to step down into it, he pivoted back, caught
      her up bodily in his arms, and, laughing, ran with her down the hill,
      bounding over the rocks, leaping over the crevices, while she clung to him
      in fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You silly child!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This is the way I&rsquo;ll take you home. Now I&rsquo;ve
      got you, and I&rsquo;ll punish you well, too.&rdquo; She clung to him and begged him
      to stop. She was frightened by their rash, plunging progress, by his
      speech. She struggled. &ldquo;Let me down. I won&rsquo;t be carried like this against
      my will. Hugh, let me down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; He fairly flung her from him on a grassy spot. He was about
      to leave her when a rushing rattle sounded above them. The boulder he had
      twice used to turn his own weight upon was charging down the hillside!
      Just in time he caught Sylvie, threw her to one side and fell prone,
      helpless, in the path of the slide. He cried out, flinging up his arm,
      and, as though his cry had been of magic, the boulder faltered and
      stopped. A root half buried just above his body had made a hollow and a
      ledge; it had rocked the rolling fragment back up on its haunches, so to
      speak, and balanced it to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh! Hugh!&rdquo; sobbed Sylvie. &ldquo;What was it? Are you hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She crept up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Hugh told her, breathing heavily. &ldquo;It was a rolling rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you stop it? You must be hurt, crushed, bruised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My arm&rsquo;s wrenched&mdash;not badly.&rdquo; He had in fact wrenched it slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your poor arm! You were so quick, so strong. You didn&rsquo;t think of your own
      life. And I&rsquo;ve been so cruel. Hugh, Hugh, kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh took his reward, none the less sweet to his strange nature, in that
      it was only potentially earned. And joy, like a warm flood, crept up again
      to his heart. He sat on the hillside and held his small love close. One of
      his arms moved stiffly, and he groaned a little. She rubbed it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come home and let Bella and me fix it. It may be badly hurt.
      You&rsquo;re sure it isn&rsquo;t broken?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lean on me! I&rsquo;ll help you down. You can tell me where to step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he laughed, his very blood singing warm with relief. &ldquo;A
      strained arm won&rsquo;t hurt my walking apparatus. We had a lover&rsquo;s quarrel,
      didn&rsquo;t we? And the boulder was peacemaker. Bless the boulder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke, dear. You saved my life at the risk of your own. Are you
      always doing insane, generous, dangerous things? Think if you had been&mdash;&rdquo;
       She shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose my life is worth anything to me without yours, Sylvie?&rdquo; He
      bent his head and kissed her again, but he had learned his lesson, and
      there was restraint and timidity in that kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s come out,&rdquo; cried Sylvie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s splendidly bright. There&rsquo;s a clean slit in the sky; there at
      the western edge the dark gray cap is being lifted inch by inch, the way a
      boy lifts his cap to see the butterfly he&rsquo;s caught. All&rsquo;s gold behind it,
      Sylvie, burning gold. The rocks are like bright copper. And the pines,
      they&rsquo;re incandescent, phosphorescent green&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only see it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down near the pines a tall, still figure stood watching them. It was Pete,
      and his smile, usually so frank and sweet, had now a sardonic twist. As
      they came down out of their sun into his shadow, he spoke with a drag to
      his syllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That was a narrow escape you had, you two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice might have been a pistol-shot for the start it gave to Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Pete. We must be late, Pete,&rdquo; Sylvie called joyously. &ldquo;Did you
      see how Hugh saved my life? He threw himself down before the rock and
      stopped it. He&rsquo;s hurt his poor arm. The great stone was right on top of
      us, and he threw me out of the way and set his own strength against it. I
      couldn&rsquo;t see the rock, Pete, but it felt like a mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was big enough to smash you both,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Hugh, whose eyes glared in a strained, shamed face. The older
      man&rsquo;s fingers worked nervously; he opened his lips and closed them again.
      It was easy to understand the travail of his mind, unwilling to forego the
      imaginary bit of heroism, and yet abashed by the boy&rsquo;s awareness of the
      lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete gave one short laugh; then, springing suddenly across a fallen tree
      that separated them, he caught Sylvie up into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t carry her with a wrenched arm,&rdquo; he said, half gayly, half
      tauntingly, &ldquo;and at the best rate she can go, it will be night before we
      get her home. I&rsquo;m strong. I&rsquo;ll carry her myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie laughed protesting that she was being treated like a doll, and
      resigned herself to Pete&rsquo;s swift, smooth stride. It was as though she were
      skimming through space, so quietly did his moccasined feet press the
      pine-needled earth, so exquisitely did his young strength save her from
      any jar. He whistled softly through his teeth as he ran in long, swift
      strides. And as he did not speak to her, she lay silent, yet strangely
      peaceful and happy. Hugh was left far behind. The forest fragrance moved
      cool and resinous against her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel as if we could go on and on forever,&rdquo; she said with a sigh,
      &ldquo;forever and ever and ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will,&rdquo; he answered through his teeth, hardly pausing in his whistling
      for the odd reply. &ldquo;We will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for all that, he set her gently and suddenly down, and she knew that
      she stood again at the cabin door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete, where are you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had disappeared, still in utter silence, like a genie whose task is
      done.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say to you? What did he say to you?&rdquo; asked Hugh again and
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie laughed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say anything&mdash;hardly a word, except that he pretended he
      was going on forever. He said: &lsquo;We will, we will.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s absolutely all,
      Hugh. Don&rsquo;t be so silly. What <i>could</i> he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Hugh answered. &ldquo;He might have made fun of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fun of you! After saving my life! I&rsquo;d have boxed his ears! No, no, Peter
      wouldn&rsquo;t do that. He&rsquo;s afraid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so proud of this that Hugh, perforce, laughed. It was after
      supper, and they had walked a little way from the cabin. They were
      standing just above the river on a little hillock topped with three big
      pines. The dusk was thick about them; stars pricked the soft sky. Sylvie
      was wrapped in Hugh&rsquo;s coat, and they were linked by their hands hanging at
      their sides. Every one but Sylvie had been very silent at supper, but she
      had told her story of Hugh&rsquo;s heroism again and again until finally even
      Hugh had grumbled at &ldquo;the fuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think anyone could be afraid of you?&rdquo; He smiled down at
      the small dark head which did not reach his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid I&rsquo;ll kiss him. Don&rsquo;t grip my hand that way; it hurts. You
      couldn&rsquo;t be jealous of a boy! Besides, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> kiss him any more. I
      never have kissed him but that once&mdash;no, twice, when I told him that
      I was going to be his sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told him that?&rdquo; Hugh&rsquo;s voice had an odd anxiety. &ldquo;How did he take
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he was very enthusiastic. He loves you so much, Hugh; you
      are the very heart of his universe, and I suppose he is jealous of your
      love for me. Since then he&rsquo;s avoided me and is as dumb as a fish when I
      talk to him. I think his body has outgrown his mind, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bella is so silent, too. Hugh, it must have been a lonely life for
      you before I came. Those two people, though they love you so much, are not
      companionable. I think, Hugh, that they aren&rsquo;t able to understand you. You
      are so brilliant, and they are so dull; you are so articulate, and they
      are so dumb; you are so warm, so quick to see, to feel, to sympathize,
      while they are so slow and so cold. Dear Hugh, I&rsquo;m glad I came. I am
      stupid myself, but I have enough intelligence to understand you&mdash;a
      little, haven&rsquo;t I, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much more than enough!&rdquo; The low speech with its tremor of humility was
      almost lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a noise the river makes!&rdquo; he said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And the pines. The whole air is full of rushing and sighing and
      clapping and rattling. Sounds tell me so much now. They fill my whole
      life. It is very queer. Why, a voice means more to me now, I think, than a
      face ever did.... Is it a deep river, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it is&mdash;deep and dangerous. But it goes down very quickly when
      the snow at its source has melted. In summer it is a friendly little
      brook, and in the fall a mere trickle that hardly wets your shoe. I have a
      boat here tied to the root of one of these trees, a boat I made myself, to
      pole across when the stream is too deep for wading. I&rsquo;ll take you out in
      it when the flood&rsquo;s down; it wouldn&rsquo;t last fifteen minutes now. In the
      spring, Sylvie, a nymph comes down from the mountain, a wild white nymph.
      She has ice-green hair and frost-white arms; you can see her lashing the
      water, and if you listen, you can hear her sing and cry. Let&rsquo;s go in,
      dear; you&rsquo;re tired and cold&mdash;I can feel you shivering. We&rsquo;ll start a
      big fire, and I&rsquo;ll tell you how that nymph caught me once and nearly
      strangled me with her cold, wet arms. I was trying to save&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      laugh when I tell you about it&mdash;a baby bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete and Bella made room for them silently about the hearth where Pete had
      already built up a fire. Sylvie groped her way to the throne from which
      the other woman slipped half furtively and so noiselessly that Sylvie
      never guessed her usurpation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh is going to tell us a story,&rdquo; she said, and rested her head back so
      that her small chin pointed out and her slim neck was drawn up&mdash;&ldquo;a
      wonderful story about the river and a bear. I hope it&rsquo;s a baby bear, Hugh,
      for you know how I feel about bears. I honestly think that being so afraid
      of seeing them is what made me blind!&rdquo; She gave her small, shy laugh. &ldquo;I
      thought I saw them everywhere I looked that day and night. It seems so
      long ago now, and yet it is not so many weeks. I can still hear Hugh&rsquo;s
      voice calling out to me across the snow. And now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the snow&rsquo;s
      all gone and none of you are strangers any more, and&mdash;Go on with your
      story, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete added a log to the fire so that the flames stretched up bravely and
      made a great fan of light against which they all seemed painted like
      ornamental figures, Hugh lounging along the rug to make a striking central
      figure. Bella was drawn up rigidly on a stiff, hard chair; she hemmed a
      long, coarse towel with her blunt, work-roughened fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete sat opposite Sylvie on the floor, his back against the corner of the
      fireplace, his knees drawn up in his hands, his head a little bent. He too&mdash;from
      under his long level brows&mdash;looked for the most part at Hugh, not
      devotedly, not wistfully, but with a somber wondering. It was only now and
      then, and as though he couldn&rsquo;t help it, that the blue, smouldering
      Northern eyes were turned to Sylvie on her throne. Then they would
      brighten painfully, and his lips would tighten so that the dimple, meant
      for laughter, cut itself like a touch of pain into his cheek. The
      firelight heightened his picturesqueness&mdash;the dull blue of his shirt,
      open at the round, smooth throat, the dark gold-brown of his corduroy
      trousers, against which the long, tanned hands, knit strongly together,
      stood out in the rosy, leaping light&mdash;beautifully painted against the
      background of old brown logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was Hugh, after all, who dominated the room by right of his power,
      his magnetism, the very distortion of his spirit. Here in this lonely
      square of light and warmth, surrounded by a world of savage, lawless winds
      heightening the voices of vast loneliness, these three people were
      imprisoned by him, a Merlin of the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up to begin his story, pressing tobacco into his pipe. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s
      not so much of a story, Sylvie. It was last spring when the river was high
      and I&rsquo;d been out with my traps. I was coming home along the river edge,
      pretty tired, a big load on my back. I came around a bend of the river,
      and not far below me a little black bear, round as a barrel, was trying to
      scramble over the flood on a very shaky log. The mother was on the other
      side, but I didn&rsquo;t know that then. Well, there&rsquo;s nothing in God&rsquo;s world,
      Sylvie, so beguiling as a baby bear. This little fellow was scared by what
      he was doing, but he was bound he&rsquo;d get across the river. He&rsquo;d make a few
      steps; then he&rsquo;d back up and half rise on his hind legs. I watched him a
      long time. Then he made up his mind he&rsquo;d better make a dash for it. He
      began scrambling like a frantic kitten, and it was just in the most
      ticklish spot that he heard me and jumped and went rolling off into the
      river. I tell you, my heart came right up into my mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>was</i> he drowned?&rdquo; wailed Sylvie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh rose and stood with his back to the fire, dominating the room even
      more convincingly, with his vivid ugliness. Sylvie&rsquo;s face turned up to him
      like a white flower to the sun it lives by, without seeing. It was strange
      to watch the adoration, the worship on that small face, and at the same
      time to behold the grotesqueness toward which it was directed. Bella was
      listening with her lowered eyes and tightened lips. She was interested in
      spite of herself; and Pete&rsquo;s inscrutable face followed the story with
      absorption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in he rolled with a splash and went rattling down the current,
      turning over and over. Like a fool, I threw away my hides, ran down the
      bank and jumped in after him&mdash;that is, I meant to hold on to a branch
      and stand out in the water and catch him as he went by. But the nymph I
      told you about had her own plans. She wrapped her arms round me, and away
      we went, bear all. Oh, yes, I&rsquo;d caught the cub all right, and he was about
      half drowned by that time&mdash;no fight left in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for a bit it was a question whether the world wouldn&rsquo;t be quickly
      and well rid of us both, but we tumbled up against a root and scrambled
      out, and when I&rsquo;d rested, I picked up limp and trembling Master Bear and
      went back for my hides. And while I was collecting them, I heard a sort of
      grumpy, grumbling sound, and I looked up&mdash;and, by Jove, Mother Bear
      was coming across that log with the longest steps you ever saw. That&rsquo;s
      when I ran to collect my gun&mdash;it was a little farther up the bank
      than my hides, worse luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Bella had forgotten her bitterness in listening, and Pete&rsquo;s parted
      lips were those of an excited child. Sylvie leaned forward in her chair,
      her cheeks tingling, her hands locked. Hugh had thrown himself into the
      action of his story; his face was slightly contorted as though sighting
      along a gun-barrel, his arm raised, the ungainliness of his deformity
      strongly accentuated. He was not looking at Sylvie; true to his nature and
      his habit, he had forgotten every one but that Hugh of adventure and of
      romance, the one companion of his soul. None of them was watching Sylvie,
      and when she gave a sharp, little cry, a queer start and then sat utterly
      still, Hugh accepted it&mdash;they all accepted it&mdash;as a tribute to
      his story-telling powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sylvie, leaning her elbows on her knees, raised trembling hands to her
      eyes and hid them. She sat very still, very white, while the story went
      on, vividly imagined, picturesquely told. When it was over, and the mother
      bear, after a worthy struggle, defeated, Hugh looked about for his
      applause. It came, grudgingly from Bella, eagerly from Pete&mdash;and from
      Sylvie in a sudden extravagant clapping of hands, a ripple of high,
      excited laughter, and a collapse in her chair. She had fainted in a limp
      little heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to in an instant, but seemed bewildered and, unprotesting,
      permitted herself to be carried to bed. She declared she felt quite well
      again and wanted only to be alone. She repeated this moaningly. &ldquo;Oh, to be
      alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh seated himself on the end of the bed and kissed her forehead and her
      hand, but it quivered under his lips and was drawn away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back into the living-room with a pale, bewildered face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next day there came out of that room a new Sylvie or rather a dozen new
      Sylvies: a flighty witch of a Sylvie who tempted her blindness with rash
      ventures about the rooms and even out of doors, who laughed at Hugh and
      led him on, and drew him out to his maddest improvisations, who treated
      Pete to snubs and tauntings that stung like so many little whips; and
      again a Sylvie who was still and timid and a trifle furtive, who rarely
      spoke, but sat with locked hands in an attitude of desperate concentration
      and seemed to be planning something secret and dangerous; and then there
      was a haughty, touch-me-not Sylvie; and a Sylvie who mysteriously wept.
      But all of these Sylvies showed an impetuous, new tenderness toward Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been all wrong about you, Bella,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re not
      really old and ugly and cross at all. Let me touch your face.&rdquo; Bella,
      awkward and flushed, had no choice but to submit to the flick of the
      light, young fingers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning the touch of the blind,&rdquo; Sylvie
      boasted. &ldquo;Now, listen&mdash;isn&rsquo;t this right? You have thick, straight
      eyebrows and deep-set eyes; are they blue or brown, Bella, or bright
      gray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gray,&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh was watching from eyes sunk in a nervous, pallid face. He had come in
      from his traps in the midst of Sylvie&rsquo;s experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she has a nice, straight, strong, short nose, and a mouth that she
      holds too tight. Loosen your mouth, Bella; it might be very sweet if you
      gave it a chance. And she has a sharp chin&mdash;not pretty, your chin,
      but&mdash;look! If you&rsquo;d soften your hair, pull it over your ears and
      forehead&mdash;Why do you brush it back that way? It <i>must</i> be
      unbecoming. And, Bella, it&rsquo;s curly, or would be with a little freedom.
      What color is your hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gray&mdash;like my eyes,&rdquo; said Bella, scarlet now, and trying to draw
      herself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really gray, Pete? Tell me the truth, if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her hair is a very light brown,&rdquo; said Pete, flushed as scarlet now as
      Bella; &ldquo;sort of a grayish brown; you wouldn&rsquo;t notice any gray hairs,
      hardly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella, I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t look a day older than thirty-five. Your skin
      feels smooth and young. Why do you let Hugh call you an old woman? Poor
      Bella, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve spoiled those two boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie turned suddenly and imperiously upon the men, and Bella made her
      escape, not from the room, for she was too stirred, too full of an excited
      suspense, to bring herself to leave. From a far corner, near the window
      through which came the soft May wind, she watched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Pete,&rdquo; said Sylvie, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your turn. If I&rsquo;m to learn the touch of
      the blind, I must have practice. What can I make of you! Come here. Why
      don&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo; She stamped her foot. &ldquo;My, but you are badly trained.
      Really, Hugh, you ought to discipline him. Wait until I am your
      sister-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh started angrily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t joke about that!&rdquo; he threatened in a harsh,
      sudden voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned toward him with quickness and bent her head sidelong as though
      listening intently for what else he might have to say. Her lips were set
      close and narrow. She had listened to him like this, almost breathlessly,
      ever since her sudden faintness, listened as though she would draw his
      very soul in through her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He too flushed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s life and death to me, Sylvie,&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life and death&mdash;life <i>or</i> death,&rdquo; she repeated strangely. She
      stood, as if turning the speech over in her mind, then gave her head a
      quick little shake like a diver coming to the surface of deep water, and
      moved a step toward Pete. &ldquo;Are you coming, boy, or not? I want to feel
      your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as she says,&rdquo; Hugh commanded harshly, and Pete came slowly to her and
      stood with his hands locked behind him, bending over the little figure.
      She put her hands on his shoulders and gave him a shake, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a big, strong boy! Where&rsquo;s your face?&rdquo; It winced and paled under her
      touch. His eyes fell, shifted, could not meet Hugh&rsquo;s, who watched with
      unsteady breathing and white lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your face is as smooth as a girl&rsquo;s, Pete. What a wide, low forehead and
      crisp, short hair; it ripples back from your temples. You must be a pretty
      boy! A neat nose and a round, hard chin and&mdash;oh, Pete, Pete! I
      believe you have a dimple. How absurd! A great, long dimple like a slit in
      your right cheek. Why do you blink your eyes so? They&rsquo;re long eyes, with
      thick, short lashes. What a strong, round neck! I think I like your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She patted his cheek, the pat more like a smart slap. He pulled away.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for disobedience. Come back. I&rsquo;m not through with you. Where&rsquo;s
      your mouth? A big, long mouth. Pete, why does your mouth tremble?&rdquo; Her
      hand fell from his lips, and she turned away. &ldquo;Take me out for a walk,
      Hugh, please,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This cabin is stuffy, now that the days are
      warm. I want to sit under the pines and listen to the river. You can tell
      me one of your wonderful stories about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean, Bella?&rdquo; Pete asked breathlessly when Hugh had gone
      out, not so much leading the girl as hurrying after her to save her from
      the rashness of her impetuous progress. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; Pete was as
      white as paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Bella came over from the window and stood by the
      fireplace, rolling her arms in her apron and shaking her head. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
      crazy little witch. She&rsquo;ll drive us mad. Hugh is half mad now&mdash;have
      you noticed? She won&rsquo;t let him touch her. And you, poor boy! Pete, why
      don&rsquo;t you go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He flung himself down
      in Hugh&rsquo;s chair and rested his head in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella bent over him. &ldquo;Poor Pete! It&rsquo;s cruel for you&mdash;and,&rdquo; she added
      softly, uncertainly, &ldquo;and for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you too, Bella?&rdquo; He looked up at her through tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her head, and her face worked. &ldquo;Perhaps you could take her back
      to her friends, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave Hugh? Didn&rsquo;t you hear what he said, Bella? Life and death! It
      would kill him if she should go away with me. Or&mdash;he&rsquo;d follow and
      kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bella assented somberly; &ldquo;yes, he&rsquo;d kill you. The devil is still
      living in his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Sylvie will marry him. Hugh gets his will.&rdquo; Pete shook his head.
      &ldquo;Wait a few days&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see. She&rsquo;s fighting against him now; I don&rsquo;t
      know why&mdash;some instinct. But though he tells her so many lies, he
      doesn&rsquo;t lie about one thing. He loves her. He does love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Bella&rsquo;s passion, tearing its way through her long habit of
      repression, was almost terrifying. &ldquo;He loves the image she has of him. If
      he knew that she could see him as I do, his love would shrivel up like a
      flower in a drought. Hugh can&rsquo;t love the truth. He can&rsquo;t love anything but
      his delusions. Pete, tell her the truth. For God&rsquo;s sake, tell her the
      truth. Give her back her eyesight. Let her know his name, his story&mdash;his
      <i>face</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare ask me, Bella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; She seemed to be out of breath, like a person who has been
      climbing in thin air. Her lips were dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;well, would you do it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! He would hate me, if I did. But you, Pete, when Sylvie loved you&mdash;and
      if she knew you, she would surely love you; any woman would&mdash;why,
      then you could bear Hugh&rsquo;s hatred. I have only him&mdash;only him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She locked her hands and lifted them to her forehead and was now making
      blind steps toward the kitchen door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete followed her, and turning her about, drew down the hands from her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella&mdash;<i>you</i>? Without saying a word? All these years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the first pressure of sympathy that her agony had ever known, she
      could not speak. She bent her head for an instant against his arm, then
      moved away from him, groping through the kitchen door, back to her
      unutterable loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete stood staring after her. A new Bella, this, not the cousin, the
      little cousin from the farm; not the nurse who had saved him from Hugh&rsquo;s
      hardness and told him limping fairy tales and doctored his hurts; not the
      accepted necessity, but a woman&mdash;a woman young, yes, young. In the
      instant when he had glimpsed her face, broken and quivering, the tight
      lips parted and the hair disarranged about flushed, quivering cheeks, the
      eyes deep with widened pupils, she had revealed beauty and passion&mdash;the
      two halves of youth. How blind, how blind Hugh had been, blind and selfish
      and greedy, drinking up the woman&rsquo;s heart, feeding upon her youth!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you sit so silent, Pete,&rdquo; Sylvie said softly, &ldquo;I sometimes wonder if
      you&rsquo;re not staring at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m making a trap,&rdquo; he answered, smiling a little to himself and
      instinctively shifting his gaze, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t very well be staring at you, can
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was kneeling on the ground before the cabin door, she sitting on the
      low step under the shadow of the roof. Her chin rested on the backs of her
      hands, the limber wrists bent up a little, the sleeves slipped away from
      her slim, white wrists. Her face was brightly rosy, her lips very red&mdash;at
      once a little stern, yet very sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Traps are cruel,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so myself. But we have to make a living, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself sometimes, Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For making traps, and catching live things in them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s a sort of deceitful cruelty, catching the little blind,
      wandering wild things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blind?&rdquo; he repeated blankly, then flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, blind. But it wasn&rsquo;t only that I meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else ought I to be ashamed of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of living on your brother.&rdquo; He winced sharply, but she went on coolly:
      &ldquo;Of staying here in the wilderness. You are a big boy now. Many a boy of
      your age, even smaller and weaker, has gone out in the world to make his
      own way. There&rsquo;s no reason for <i>you</i> to hide, is there? <i>You</i>
      haven&rsquo;t sacrificed your life for anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered doubtfully, &ldquo;n-no; but, you see, Sylvie, some one has to
      take the skins. It isn&rsquo;t safe for Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course. So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll do all your life&mdash;carry loads
      to and fro, between this cabin and the trading-station. But if Hugh goes
      away himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he asked breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His skillful hands paused in their fashioning of a snare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, of course, that he wants to take me away with him, to marry me,
      to start life again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and you will, Sylvie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your advice,&rdquo; she said. She pressed her red lips together; her
      face was bent upon him as though she watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;you tell me all the time, a dozen times a day, that
      I&rsquo;m badly trained. What good&rsquo;s my advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Are</i> you badly trained?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are absurdly unselfish, Pete!&rdquo; She moved a chip along the ground with
      her foot, but Pete failed to notice this curious seeing gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited, waited until, in the sickness of his vague suspense, his hands
      had turned cold and the color had sucked itself in irregular heartbeats
      from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she spoke deliberately. &ldquo;You would lay down your life for your
      friend?&rdquo; she said. It was almost a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete&rsquo;s face went red and white and red again. Through the tumult of his
      heart he searched for loyal words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love Hugh&mdash;if that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you?&rdquo; she repeated softly, perversely. &ldquo;Did you say &lsquo;Hugh&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;you,&rsquo; Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face tightened; faint lines came about his mouth. &ldquo;I said &lsquo;Hugh!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;you love only him&mdash;nobody else in all the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her young and wistful voice came to him like a fragrance. He struggled as
      though his spirit were fighting in deep water. He tried to remember Hugh.
      He rose up slowly to meet this passionate moment, and now he made a short
      step toward the waiting girl. She <i>was</i> waiting, breathing fast.
      Pete&rsquo;s arms quivered at his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand gripped the quivering muscles and turned him about. Hugh had come
      up behind, without sound, on moccasined feet. His face was gray; his eyes
      were drawn into slits; his distorted mouth was trying to become a
      straight, hard line. The effort gave a twitch to the pale, lower lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie stood up, singing as though in absent-minded idleness, and vanished
      into the house. It would have been difficult to tell whether or not she
      had heard Hugh&rsquo;s arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Pete stammered like a boy wakened from a dream to
      behold a lifted cane. &ldquo;Let go my arm, Hugh. Your fingers cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away from the house,&rdquo; said Hugh coldly, tightening the iron grip as
      though Pete&rsquo;s wincing gave him satisfaction. &ldquo;Come up here by the pines. I
      want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Pete. &ldquo;Let go my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was that in his voice that compelled obedience. Hugh&rsquo;s hand fell and
      knotted into a fist. Pete walked beside him up the abrupt slope of their
      hollow to the little hill above the river. Its noise was loud in the
      still, sunny air. There was no wind stirring. It was high noon. A sloping
      tent of shadow drooped from the pines and made a dark circle about their
      roots. In this transparent, purplish tent the brothers faced each other.
      Pete&rsquo;s lips were tremulous, and Hugh&rsquo;s distorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Hugh, breathing irregularly and speaking very low, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
      you what I think of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Hugh, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Pete pleaded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll say things you don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;unkind
      things, terrible things. I don&rsquo;t deserve it from you. You&mdash;you think
      that I&mdash;that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on. Don&rsquo;t stop. Tell me what I think&mdash;I think&mdash;that you&mdash;that
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an unbearable moment, an impossible atmosphere, for the revelation
      of a first love. Pete felt stripped and shamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that I was telling Sylvie, that Sylvie&mdash;that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh lifted his hand and struck. The younger man sprang back, then
      forward, and was at his elder&rsquo;s throat. For an instant they struggled,
      silently, terribly, slipping on the red pine-needles. Then Pete gave a
      hard laugh. &ldquo;Are we tigers?&rdquo; he asked, and he pulled himself back and
      leaned, shaking, against a tree-trunk, gripping it with his hands. His
      blue eyes were cold and blazing in his white face, against which Hugh&rsquo;s
      blow had made a mark. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t strike me again,&rdquo; Pete said. All
      boyishness was gone from his hard, level voice. &ldquo;Go on. Say what you like.
      I&rsquo;ll listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You liar!&rdquo; stormed Hugh. &ldquo;You cheat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain quality in his bitter self-control flicked Hugh. He tried to
      emulate the young man&rsquo;s coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve trusted you,&rdquo; he began again; &ldquo;and behind my back you have been
      trying to win the love of the woman who has promised to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not making love to her there, then, when I came up behind you?
      When you were so excited that you didn&rsquo;t hear me? when you were moving
      toward her&mdash;trembling all over? <i>I</i> felt your arm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete&rsquo;s eyes dropped, then lifted as though under a great weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you say you&rsquo;re not a liar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> a liar, though not in the way you mean. We are all liars. We
      have caught that little blind girl in a trap. We have lied to her, all
      three of us&mdash;Bella and I, and you, Hugh&mdash;you have lied most of
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves me,&rdquo; Hugh panted. &ldquo;She knows me. She understands me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pete answered, trembling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that. I&rsquo;ve kept quiet. Bella
      and I have given you your happiness. Now you thank me by striking me and
      calling me a liar and a cheat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh, even in the midst of his bitter and suspicious rage, felt the
      justice of the reproach. He paused, looked about, then came close, put a
      hand on each of his brother&rsquo;s shoulders, searching the white, young face
      with his wild eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have Sylvie,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Pete, I must. You don&rsquo;t know; you can&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;&rdquo; He dropped his grizzled head against Pete&rsquo;s neck, and his
      breath caught. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I felt when I saw you there, when I
      thought&mdash;Tell me the truth, Pete. You are not going to take my love,
      my only joy, my one prize away from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a long and difficult silence Pete put his arm half mechanically
      across the twisted, gasping back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, Hugh. I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;ve had to play a part, and
      it&rsquo;s not come easy. You must have guessed how hard it&rsquo;s been, because you
      seem to have guessed how I&mdash;how Sylvie&mdash;Perhaps if I went away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gripped again, shaken a little. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t leave me. Wait. It won&rsquo;t
      be long. She will go away with me soon, as soon as she gets over a girl&rsquo;s
      timidity. Pete, she does love me. She does. Don&rsquo;t stand dumb; tell me that
      she does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does,&rdquo; Pete repeated tonelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I struck you. I have a devil&rsquo;s temper. And I think of you as
      still a boy. I wanted to beat you. A few years ago I would have beaten
      you.&rdquo; He put this forward as though it were a reasonable excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Pete smiled grimly. &ldquo;I can remember your beatings.&rdquo; He drew himself
      away. &ldquo;Shall we go back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh still held him, though at arm&rsquo;s length. &ldquo;First I must have a promise
      from you.&rdquo; He spoke sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want your promise to keep hands off, to hold your tongue to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t trust me, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since I watched you moving toward her, not since I felt your arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete was silent. He studied the ground. There was a sullen look on his
      face, and his tightened mouth deepened the odd, incongruous dimple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps you&rsquo;re right. I promise.&rdquo; He flashed up a blue desperation
      of young eyes as he asked: &ldquo;How long will it last, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long. Not long. Surely not long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came back down from the hill.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pete looked forward with white-hot impatience to the day of his trip to
      the trading-station; twelve hours of relief, it would mean, from the worst
      pressure of his torment&mdash;twelve hours of merciful solitude in the
      old, voiceful friendliness of his forest trail. He started early, at the
      break of a sweet, singing dawn. The earth was elastic under his feet, the
      air tingling and mellow with a taste of growth; the flooded river
      chattered loudly like a creature half beside itself with joy. Pete came
      out of the dark and silent cabin in which he had made his tiptoe
      preparations, and lifted his face, letting the light, soft fingers of the
      wind, cooler and softer even than Sylvie&rsquo;s, smooth out the knots of
      suffering from his tired brain. He shook his shoulders before settling
      them under the load of pelts. He would, he swore, just for this day, be a
      boy again. He sprang lightly up from the hollow and strode forward with
      long, swift steps, swinging a companionable stick in his free hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loneliness and the dawn and love had made a poet of the young man, so that
      he had the release of poetry and forgot reality in its translation into a
      tale that is told. He thought of Sylvie, but he thought of her as a man
      thinks of a lovely memory. He went through the wood with his chin lifted,
      half smiling, almost happy, an integral part of the wild, glad, wistful
      spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the afternoon when he was nearing the station&mdash;just,
      in fact, before he left the wood-trail for the rutted, frontier road&mdash;that
      his mind was caught as sharply as a cloth by a needle, by the light sound
      of following steps. In the solitude of that trail which his feet alone had
      worn, the sound brought him to a stop with a sense of terror and suspense.
      His mind leaped to Hugh, and for the first time in his loyal life Pete
      remembered, and remembering, felt a creeping on his skin, that this
      brother of his, who had grown harsh and jealous and suspicious, had been a
      murderer. The cold, unkindly memory slid along his senses like a snake. On
      the edge of the sloping road-bank, studded with little yellow flowers,
      just where the trees stopped, Pete set down his load and waited,
      instinctively bracing his body, drawing it back beneath the shelter of one
      of the big pines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps were light and swift and stealthy. In the purplish confusion of
      the distance, a tangled and yet ordered regiment of trunks and boughs,
      sun-splotches and shadow-blots, through which the uncertain trail seemed
      to rise like a slender thread of smoke to the pale, flecked sky, Pete made
      out a moving shape. It slipped in and out; it hesitated, hurried, paused,
      moved on. With a shudder of relief and of surprise, Pete saw it; out from
      behind the great, close trunks came Sylvie, her chin lifted, her hands
      stretched out on either side, brushing the swinging branches along the
      trail, her small head turning from this side to that, as though she
      listened in suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete called out her name and ran quickly to meet her. Forgetting his part
      of a dull, sullen boy, he spoke eagerly, catching her hand, watching the
      warm, happy blush flow in her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo; she asked. She had stood to wait for him as soon as his
      voice reached her. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see&mdash;I mean, I lost the sound of your
      steps. I&rsquo;ve been following you for hours and hours and hours. I was so
      afraid of being lost again that I didn&rsquo;t dare drop too far behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you call to me? Why have you come? Is anything wrong at
      home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers moved uncertainly in his grasp, like the fingers of a shy
      child. &ldquo;Nothing is wrong. I wanted to come with you. I wanted to go to the
      trading-station and the post-office. I didn&rsquo;t dare ask you to take me with
      you. I was afraid you&rsquo;d send me home. I suppose I&rsquo;ll be a nuisance, but&mdash;Oh,
      Pete, please be nice to me and take care of me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She paused,
      turned her face away from him and smiled. &ldquo;After all, since you have
      called me your wife before witnesses, you ought to introduce me to your
      friends at the trading-station, oughtn&rsquo;t you? They might think it was
      queer that I should hide myself, now that the snow has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped her hand. Suddenly he realized the consequences, the necessary
      effect upon Hugh of this willful venture of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Hugh know where you are?&rdquo; he asked painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I ran away. I heard you getting ready, and I just felt that I
      couldn&rsquo;t bear to be left behind. I slipped out of bed so quietly that
      Bella didn&rsquo;t even stir, and I dressed just as quietly, and when you had
      gone half across the clearing, I ran out after you, listening to your
      steps. You see, I have the hearing, as well as the touch, of the blind.&rdquo;
       This was said with a cunning sort of recklessness; but Pete, absorbed in
      his anxiety, did not challenge the improbable statement. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be
      angry with me, Pete.&rdquo; She touched his hand where it hung at his side.
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I have my adventure? Let&rsquo;s call it <i>ours</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, the young man&rsquo;s pulse quickened, but his face and
      voice were stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that we&rsquo;ll be very late?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will be midnight
      before we can possibly make it back to the cabin, if you can even do it at
      all. You&rsquo;ll have to spend the night somewhere at the station. What will
      they think? They will be anxious, Bella and Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can they think?&rdquo; Her cheeks were unexplainably scarlet. &ldquo;If I
      choose to trust you to take care of me, why should they grumble? And I
      won&rsquo;t have to spend the night. You don&rsquo;t know how strong I am. I&rsquo;m very
      strong. I don&rsquo;t feel tired. We&rsquo;ll go back by moonlight. There&rsquo;s a
      beautiful moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be almost morning.&rdquo; He made a reckless gesture. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too
      late to think of that now. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself down the bank, held up his hands to catch hers, and swung
      her down beside him. The sun slanted warmly along the road and just ahead
      flickered the blue ripples of a lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie moved quickly and easily beside him, barely touching his arm with
      her hand. She seemed definitely to decide to put away her childishness.
      She treated him as though she had forgotten his supposed youth; she talked
      straightforwardly, with a certain dignity, about her childhood, about her
      amusing and pitiful experience as a third-rate little actress, and she
      asked him a question now and then half diffidently, which he answered in
      stumbling, careful speech, always weighed upon by his promise, by the
      deception he must practice, by the dread of what must come. Nevertheless,
      minute by minute, his pulse quickened. This, God be thanked, would mean
      the end. The insufferable knot of circumstance, so fantastic, so
      extravagantly unlivable and unreal, would break, Hugh would tear the
      tangle of his making to tatters with angry hands when they got back. His
      difficult trust in Pete&rsquo;s promise would go down under the strain of these
      long and unexplained hours of Sylvie&rsquo;s absence in his company. It was the
      last act in the extravaganza, queer and painful, that had twisted them all
      out of their real shapes for the confusion of a blind waif. This adventure
      that Sylvie&rsquo;s impatience had planned would bring down the curtain. After
      all, no matter what came of it, Pete was glad. The color warmed his face;
      his blue eyes deepened; he smiled down at Sylvie beside him. For this hour
      she seemed to belong to him rightfully, naturally, by her own will. He let
      go of his inhibitions and resigned himself to Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, on the far shore of the lake, the low walls of the trading-station
      came in sight, a double image, reflected faithfully with the strip of sand
      at its door, the low, level wall of pines behind and the blue, still sky
      above, Pete caught the girl&rsquo;s hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are, Sylvie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Keep quiet and follow my lead. Remember,
      now, that I am supposed to be your husband and you my wife. Can you play
      that part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, bending down her face so that he saw only the tip of her
      small, sunburnt chin. She was hatless; the sun struck blue, bright lines
      in her black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful, Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed his hand, and he returned the pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station was full of silent curiosity; a couple of squaws, a serious
      buck Indian, and a bearded trapper or two made little secret of their
      observation. In the far corner of the big, bare room, down one side of
      which ran a long and littered counter, there was another, even more
      interested spectator of the young couple&rsquo;s entrance. He sat at a small
      table under one of the high, unshaded windows, and from over a spread-out
      time-table he gave them a large and heavy share of his attention. He was a
      man of middle age and sturdy build, round, clean-shaven, dressed in
      Eastern outing clothes of dignified correctness. He put on a pair of
      glasses to peer closer at the two who came in hand in hand like
      adventuring children, with the lithe, half-fearful grace of wild things.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall and sallow man behind the counter smiled under his long, ragged,
      blond mustache and made a gesture of polite greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve sure kept us in the dark as to your movements, Peter Garth.
      We had no notion there was a bride in these parts until the sheriff
      brought us back word the other day. Ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m glad to make your
      acquaintance.&rdquo; He glanced keenly and curiously at Sylvie&rsquo;s averted face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been here before,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been suffering from
      snow-blindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s bad sometimes. Your eyes are better now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-yes, I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give you a first-class lotion, lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie and he discussed the lotion while Pete stood, drawn up, proud and
      silent, his cheeks flushed, waiting to dispose of his pelts. The bartering
      prolonged itself in spite of his best endeavors. Sylvie seemed to have no
      sense of peril or anxiety. She insisted upon taking a bite of early
      supper, forced coffee and bread and meat upon her companion, and chatted
      affably. Pete saw that the Eastern stranger had riveted upon her his
      attention, that he observed every gesture, listened to every word, and
      while she ate, that he walked over and asked a few murmured questions of
      the trader, nodding his head, then shaking it over the answers as though
      they confirmed some suspicion or anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Pete could bear the delay no longer. Gruffly he bade Sylvie come
      with him. He caught her hand and led her out, she looking back over her
      shoulder like a loath child. They had gone but a few yards along the beach
      trail when the sober, solid gentleman came out across the porch and waved
      his hand to them. Pete hastened his steps without replying. Then came a
      summons in a loud, full, authoritative voice: &ldquo;Hi, there! One moment,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was already evening; the lake was ruffled rosily under a sunset light.
      Pete stopped and turned. He waited, pale, tightlipped, and formidable;
      Sylvie moved a little closer to him. This mysterious summons gave her a
      first little spasm of distrust and fear. The man&rsquo;s square body and square,
      serious face bore down upon them, freighted with incongruous judgments. He
      came sturdily, defying the unspoken threat of loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke when he came up to them&mdash;spoke with evident effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am a minister of the gospel, and though my
      mission in this wilderness does not rightly include you in its
      ministrations, still, my conscience, the commands of my Master, will not
      allow me to neglect so obvious and urgent a call for spiritual aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Your name I didn&rsquo;t catch,&rdquo; he said doubtfully, and
      Pete did not supply the knowledge, &ldquo;but I heard you introduce this young
      woman as your wife. I watched her very closely; I watched you, too, sir; I
      took the liberty of making some inquiries about you. I have had much and
      varied experience in the study of human nature.&rdquo; Here he put out a broad,
      clean hand with square finger-tips and lifted Sylvie&rsquo;s brown, unwilling
      left hand high from her side. &ldquo;I am a minister of the gospel,&rdquo; he
      repeated. &ldquo;In a land where such a symbol is thought much of, this woman
      has no wedding-ring. There is no register of your marriage here in the one
      spot where such a registration might have been most conveniently made&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie jerked away her fingers; Pete laid down his load and slowly drew
      his right hand into a terrible fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; The square-tipped fingers were lifted deprecatingly. &ldquo;You must
      not be angry with me, my children. I am not here to judge you. I have no
      knowledge of your temptation, of your difficulties; you have met and loved
      in a wild and difficult land. I was not even sure of my surmise. Now,
      however; your silence and your anger confirm my opinion. I want only to
      offer you my services. Will you continue in your life and love as I have
      seen them to be, or will you, if only for the sake of other lives not yet
      your responsibility&mdash;perhaps, will you take advantage of this
      opportunity which God has now given you and let me make you indeed man and
      wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete&rsquo;s fist was still terrible, and his lips were gathering their words,
      when Sylvie unbelievably spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pete,&rdquo; she asked tremulously, and he felt her drawing even closer to his
      side, &ldquo;Pete, don&rsquo;t you want&mdash;you <i>do</i> want&mdash;I know&mdash;I
      mean, will you, would you&mdash;marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was dumb as a rock, and gray. His hand opened; he stared from her to
      the impossible intruder, the worker of the miracle, or rather for he felt
      like a beast trapped, the strange layer of the snare. For an instant the
      lake and the forest and the red sky turned in a great wheel before his
      eyes. Then he caught Sylvie&rsquo;s wrist almost brutally in his hand. &ldquo;Be
      quiet!&rdquo; he said; it was the savage speaking to his woman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone
      mad. Come with me. As for you, sir, my marrying or not marrying is none of
      your business&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister looked sadly up into the young man&rsquo;s white and rigid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, turned and walked back along the beach, hands locked behind his
      broad tweed back, his head bent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete tightened his grip on Sylvie&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said to her as harshly
      as before. &ldquo;We must hurry. It&rsquo;s nearly night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvie set her small teeth tight, bent down her head, and followed him
      without a word. Their silence seemed to grow into a pressure, a weight. It
      bent Pete&rsquo;s shoulders and Sylvie&rsquo;s slender neck, and whitened their lips.
      All that they did not dare to say aloud bulked itself, huge and
      thunderous, before the combined consciousness which makes a strange third
      companion in such dual silences. They dared not pause, or look at each
      other, or move their strained lips for fear truth, the desperate,
      treacherous truth, would leap out and link them like a lightning-flash.
      The somber forest enveloped them. They moved through it as through a deep
      wall that opened by enchantment. The moon came up, gibbous and white and
      glittering, paler than silver; and the forest became streaked and mottled
      with its light. A soft, sudden wind tore the light and shade into eerie,
      dancing ribbons and tatters and shreds. There were such sounds as are not
      heard in daylight&mdash;moon sounds and cloud sounds and sounds of dark
      wind; branches talked and other small voices answered in anxious
      undertones. A moose rubbed his antlers and coughed. They heard his big
      body hulking through a swamp down there in a well of darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go so fast.&rdquo; Sylvie&rsquo;s shaken voice moved doubtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled at his arm and stopped. The whole forest seemed to sway and
      stir and urge them to haste and secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A storm&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; Pete answered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t carry you, Sylvie, unless I
      leave my load.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d let you carry me?&rdquo; she answered through her set teeth.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather die here than let you lift me up in your arms. I&rsquo;ll go on till
      I drop. I don&rsquo;t care for the storm. But I can&rsquo;t walk so fast. How can you
      see? The moon isn&rsquo;t&mdash;can&rsquo;t be, I mean&mdash;very, very bright here in
      the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moon? There&rsquo;s a big storm-cloud just going to wipe it out. Listen!
      Don&rsquo;t you hear that thunder, that wind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The storm blew its distant trumpets, shouted louder, trampled the world
      with great steps, crashed and came upon them with a wet, cold blast. They
      were stunned with noise, dazzled with flashes, smothered and beaten with
      long, wet whips. Under a big rocking pine which shouted with a hundred
      confused tongues they found a dangerous shelter. Not far from them a tree
      was struck, splitting their ears, half stunning them. When the worst was
      over, Pete drew Sylvie out relentlessly and started in the heavily falling
      rain. The storm was drawing away, but the night was still impenetrably
      black. They walked for a few groping yards when Pete gave a sudden
      desperate laugh and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of this! We&rsquo;re off the trail. We&rsquo;ll have to wait for the
      light. My God! How cold and wet and trembling you are.&rdquo; He threw down his
      pack, took off his coat, wet only on the outside, and wrapped it closely
      about her. She felt that he parted branches for her, and she knew that
      they were in a dry, still, scented place whose walls stirred and breathed.
      She sank down beside him on the smooth pine-needles and crept close. They
      were giddy, beaten and confused; they felt each other&rsquo;s trembling warmth;
      for greater comfort she tucked her hands under his arm. Her head dropped
      back against his shoulder so that her breath fell on his cheek. He felt
      the silent tears of her humiliation, hot and bitter and human after the
      cold, impersonal wetness of rain. It was as though a hand drew them
      together in the darkness; they moved numbly at the same instant, by the
      same impulse; then with a sort of convulsion they were in each other&rsquo;s
      arms. Cold, wet, tremulous, their lips met. The night became the beating
      of a heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hugh sat in his great carved chair, his hands laid out across the bulky
      arms, his head bent forward a little so that his eyes encompassed all the
      restless beauty of the fire. After nightfall, when the wind began to shake
      the cabin, he had built up the fire, and its light now fought ruddily
      against the whiteness of the moon. Hugh had not lighted his lamp, nor let
      Bella light it, but he told her to make some strong coffee and keep it hot
      on the stove. &ldquo;When Sylvie comes in,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll be exhausted.
      We&rsquo;ll give her a hot drink and send her to bed, eh, Bella! The foolish
      child!&rdquo; This had been said softly, but with a wild, half-vacant look which
      Bella could not meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her belief that Pete and Sylvie had gone, not to return that night
      or any other night. In a desperate, still fashion she guarded this flaming
      conviction, peering up from long contemplations of it to learn whether
      there flickered any light of torment on Hugh&rsquo;s face. But all day, after
      the queer blankness of face and eyes with which he had first received her
      news of Sylvie&rsquo;s disappearance, he had been alternately gay and tranquil.
      All morning he had mended his boat, and in the afternoon he had cleaned
      his gun; and whenever he could cajole Bella into being his audience, he
      had talked. His talk was all of Sylvie, of her pretty childishness, her
      sweet, wayward ways, of her shyness, her timidity; and later, when supper
      was cleared away and he had throned himself in the center of that familiar
      circle of firelight, he had dropped his beautiful voice to a lower key and
      had boasted of Sylvie&rsquo;s love for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella sat on a big log sawed to the height of a low stool. She sat with
      her face bent down between her hands as though she were saving her eyes
      from the fire, but those bright, devoted eyes never left Hugh&rsquo;s face,
      though sometimes they made of it but a blurred image set in the broken
      crystals of her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, together, they heard the first rumble of the storm and saw the white
      squares of moonlight wiped from the floor as with a dark cloth. Next, the
      windows seemed to jump at them and jump away. &ldquo;Lightning!&rdquo; said Hugh.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be afraid! Will Pete be able to comfort her? Will he, Bella?&rdquo;
       Then, because she took courage to look into his face, she saw that his
      heart had been burnt all day, but that his faith, stronger than his fear,
      had kept the flame smothered, almost below his consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the storm raged across their roof, beat a brutal tattoo close above
      their deafened heads, pushed at the door, drove a pool of water under the
      threshold, Hugh walked up and down, to and fro, from fire to window, from
      door to wall, but not fast, rather with a sort of stateliness. Sometimes
      he looked sidelong at Bella&rsquo;s expressionless, listening face. At last he
      forced himself back to the chair and sat there, mechanically polishing the
      barrel of his gun, but his tongue still spoke the saga of illusion. It
      stopped when the storm dropped into the bottomless silence of dawn. Then
      there was only the dripping from their eaves. Hugh sat there, very white,
      his gun laid across his lap. Bella, as white, lifted her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; she whispered, and got stiffly to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh moved back into his chair, turning sidewise and gathering himself as
      though for a spring. His nervous hands clutched at his gun. Upon the
      silence the door opened, and Pete and Sylvie came into the room. Wet and
      storm-beaten and beautiful they were, with scarlet cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete came quickly over to Hugh&rsquo;s chair; he let fall his pack and gazed
      resolutely down at his brother&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvie had a fancy to come with me to the trading-station,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She
      came out after me and didn&rsquo;t overtake me until just where the trail comes
      out into the road. We hurried back, but the storm caught us. It was
      pitch-black in the woods; we couldn&rsquo;t keep the trail. We had to wait for
      daylight. I hope you weren&rsquo;t too anxious about her, Hugh.&mdash;Bella&rdquo;&mdash;he
      glanced over his shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;could you make us some hot coffee and
      help Sylvie into some dry clothes? We are properly drenched, both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speaker of terse, authoritative sentences was not the boy that had
      gone out that morning. That boy was gone forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh stood up and looked slowly from Sylvie, who had stayed near the door
      and held her head up like a queen, to Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you,&rdquo; he asked gently&mdash;&ldquo;where were you while it stormed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete moved toward the fire, holding out his hands. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; he shivered,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m numb with cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you,&rdquo; Hugh repeated, &ldquo;during the storm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pete lifted his eyes slowly. They were bluer than the blue heart of a
      sapphire. &ldquo;Under a pine-tree,&rdquo; he answered casually enough, and then, just
      as Hugh would have smiled, the color creeping up into his lips, Pete&rsquo;s
      young and honest blood poured over his forehead, engulfing him, blazing
      the truth across his face. Bella saw it and clenched her hands. Sylvie&rsquo;s
      cheeks, too, caught fire. Hugh turned from him, blinded by terror, saw
      Sylvie&rsquo;s trembling mouth in her dyed countenance, and turned back. He
      lifted the hand that had held, all this while, to the chair, and balled it
      into a fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strike him,&rdquo; said Sylvie quietly, not moving from her place by the
      door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever strike him again&mdash;<i>Ham Rutherford</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh&rsquo;s bones seemed to crumble; his knees bent; he leaned back against the
      chair, holding to it behind him with both hands. The gun clattered to the
      floor. In the silence Sylvie walked across the room and lifted her face.
      As if for the first time they saw her eyes, black and brilliant and young,
      sharpening the softness of her features. She looked at Hugh mercilessly,
      pitilessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been able to see you for a long time now, Ham Rutherford,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;And the instant I first saw you, I knew your name. Ever since the night
      you told me that story about the river, I&rsquo;ve been watching you. You are a
      great and infamous liar! Yes, I know that you once killed a man for
      telling you that. Kill me if you like, for I am going to repeat it after
      him&mdash;a liar, hideous and deformed outside and in. I have no pity for
      a liar. Not even your physical misfortune shall shield you! You have made
      too great a mockery of it. You brought me here, blind, as helpless as one
      of the things you catch in your traps, and you played the hero with me.
      And you fed me with lies and lies and lies. I&rsquo;ve eaten and drunk them
      until I&rsquo;m sick. Now stand up and look at the truth. You are to eat that
      until <i>you</i> are sick.&mdash;No, Bella; no, Pete; I&rsquo;m going to speak;
      no one can stop me. I know you love him. How you can look at him and see
      him as he is and know what he has done and still love him, I can&rsquo;t
      understand. Now, Hugh Garth&mdash;the name you tried to make me love you
      by&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell these people that love you, some of the beautiful
      fables with which you tried to win <i>my</i> love. Maybe, then, they will
      begin to see you as you are. Here is the first: &lsquo;There was once a very
      noble youth who had a friend&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Hugh groaned pitifully, his head bent before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I won&rsquo;t; after all, it&rsquo;s not interesting unless you&rsquo;re fool
      enough, or blind enough, to be tricked into fancying it&rsquo;s the truth. But
      let me tell them some of the other things. This noble youth, this man
      sacrificed his life for his friend and bore the blame of that friend&rsquo;s
      guilt. He is as handsome as a Viking, the very ideal of a girl&rsquo;s
      imagination, strong and shapely and graceful. Has he a humped shoulder and
      a lame leg and a scarred face revealing his scarred soul? Answer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh flinched as though under a lash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete put out his hand uncertainly; his face was drawn with pain. &ldquo;Sylvie&mdash;stop.
      You <i>must</i> stop. You&rsquo;re too cruel. He did lie to you, but remember,
      that was because he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brilliant black eyes flashed back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he loved me, you were going to say? When you love a woman, do you
      try to ruin her life? Do you creep up in the dark under cover of her
      blindness and touch her with some dreadful, poisonous wound? You don&rsquo;t
      know my horror of that man, Pete. Oh, he kissed&mdash;kissed me!&rdquo; She
      shivered. &ldquo;A murderer! Yes, a murderer. Oh, Ham Rutherford, if I could
      only <i>make</i> you see yourself! If I could give you my eyes when they
      opened, and I saw Pete&rsquo;s beauty and Bella&rsquo;s sweetness and the horrible
      ugliness of you! And then, day by day&mdash;you see, I was afraid to let
      you know that I <i>had</i> seen you. I was in terror of you, of what you
      might do to me. I was afraid of you all; you had all deceived me. Day by
      day I learned the utter distortion of you, mind, body, and soul. How could
      I help but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; She faltered and half turned to Pete, holding
      out her hands. Her indignation at the treachery practiced upon her, an
      anger that had grown in silence to unbearable heat, had spent itself in
      words. She was all for consolation now&mdash;for sympathy. But Pete
      stepped back from her. He was looking at Hugh, and his clear, young face
      was an open wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh pushed himself up and slowly lifted his face. It was then that he saw
      Sylvie&rsquo;s hands stretched out to Pete. He started&mdash;no one knew what
      the convulsive movement meant; but as he started&mdash;the gun tripped
      him. He caught it up carelessly, blindly. There was a flash&mdash;a crash.
      Pete leaped and bent, holding his arm. Blood spurted between his fingers,
      soaking his wet sleeve; and Sylvie, crying aloud, wrapped him in
      trembling, protective arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much hurt,&rdquo; he said half dazedly. &ldquo;It&mdash;it was an accident.
      He didn&rsquo;t mean it. I was looking at him. The gun went off. He didn&rsquo;t shoot
      at me.... <i>Hugh</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was staring straight ahead of him, and now he drew his hand across
      his eyes, the fingers crooked as though they tore a veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do see myself just as I am. Yes, I did shoot at you.
      Yes, I think I meant to kill you. I must have meant to kill you. That&rsquo;s
      the truth. For the second time I&rsquo;m a murderer. Yet now, as God lives, even
      if I am down in the dust, I&rsquo;ll lay hold of my stars. I&rsquo;m going to walk out
      of your lives so that they can shape themselves to their own good ends.
      Sylvie can shape yours with you, Pete.&rdquo; He hesitated a moment. &ldquo;If a
      coward, a murderer, can say &lsquo;God bless you,&rsquo; take that blessing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up his gun and shuffled across the floor, flinching aside from
      Bella as though he could bear no further touch or word, and went out of
      the door, letting in the brightness of the sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pete had sunk into a chair, faint from the shock and weakness of his
      wound; and Sylvie bent over him. For a minute, in great and bitter
      loneliness Bella stood and watched them; then she followed Hugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had put down his gun and gone slowly up from the hollow and was walking
      along the river-bank. He had the look of a man who strolls in meditation.
      When he came to his boat where it lay near the roots of the three big
      pines, he turned it over&mdash;he had been mending its bottom the morning
      of yesterday&mdash;and began to push it down toward the plunging stream.
      The glitter of morning took all the swirlings and ripplings and plungings
      of the swift water in its golden hands. Hugh steadied the boat. Above him
      on the bank Bella spoke quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;look up at me. What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his face, still holding to the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want to know? You&rsquo;ve heard the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came down the bank and stood beside him so close that her hair,
      loosened by the wind, was blown against his shoulder. She pressed it back
      and gazed into his eyes. The inner glow had worn through at last. She was
      all warmth, all flame now. She smiled with soft and parted lips. &ldquo;Do you
      think that was the truth of you, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;<i>my</i> truth of
      you? I have always seen you as you are. But&rdquo;&mdash;she drew a big breath,
      like a climber who has reached the height&mdash;&ldquo;but&mdash;I came to you,
      didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugh&rsquo;s eyes widened, the pupils swallowing her light. &ldquo;You&mdash;you came
      to me? Not for Pete&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never for his sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Bella&mdash;you laughed at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, once, for your poor folly in trying to be what you are not. When
      have I ever laughed at what you are? It&rsquo;s what you are I&rsquo;ve loved, my
      dear, just what you are&mdash;a tormented child. Only be honest with me,
      Hugh. Tell me what do you want: the moon now or&mdash;or all the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want the truth&mdash;and the end,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the flood as though it were a brook. &ldquo;I am going with you
      then. You must take me. My life has always been yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid one of his hands on either of her cheeks so that her face was
      framed for him to read. It was flushed; the deep eyes were beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;all these empty years! <i>You</i>, Bella.&rdquo; It was as though he
      saw her now for the first time. The revelation dazzled him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone
      thirsty, with wine at my elbow, until it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo; He shook his
      shoulders. &ldquo;Come with me, then, if you must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped into the boat and sat in the stern, her hands folded in her
      lap, her eyes in their great and sudden beauty still fixed on his face.
      The wind blew her hair wildly in a long, streaming veil across her
      forehead, down her cheek, out over her shoulder. She was beautiful with
      the joy that was hers at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh stepped in and stood to push the boat out from the shore. His eyes
      never left hers. It was a deep, long look of which her soul drank,
      quenching its thirst. Very slowly the boat moved; then it turned. A hand
      seemed to grip it&rsquo;s prow. There was a mighty, confused roaring in their
      ears; the bank seemed to be snatched back from them. The sunlight, shone
      into Hugh&rsquo;s face. Suddenly he caught at his oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The river is not so high,&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;the flood&rsquo;s going down.&rdquo; He
      looked away from her and back. &ldquo;We have&mdash;just a chance. We&rsquo;ll leave
      it to the river. It may be the end of you and me&mdash;or, Bella, it may
      be the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He steadied the boat with all his skill. It was drawn with frightful
      swiftness down the swollen stream.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Before noon Sylvie and Pete moved slowly across the open space and went
      back along their forest trail. They walked like lovers, and Sylvie&rsquo;s arm
      helped to support him. Just before he stepped in among the trees he turned
      for a long, desolate, backward look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the hoop of green, once white as paper under the noon sun, and the
      level, circular rim of the forest are empty and silent except for the
      rattling of the river and the moving of the pines against the fixed, grave
      stars. The human tragedy&mdash;or was it comedy?&mdash;has burnt itself
      out like the embers of a camp-fire that will never again be kindled in
      that lonely spot.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
